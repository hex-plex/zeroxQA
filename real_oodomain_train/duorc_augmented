An enraged posse of men descend on the isolated Seven Doors Hotel deep in the swamps. They grab an artist called Schweik (Antoine Saint John), who is cloistered there. Accusing him of being a warlock, Schweik is dragged down to the cellar where he is savagely beaten with heavy chains, tortured with quicklime acid, and crucified with his wrists nailed to a cellar wall, despite his dire warnings of evil to be unleashed.New Orleans, 1981. Liza Merril (Catriona MacColl) is a young woman who arrives from New York City to claim the hotel as her inheritance. No sooner has architect friend Marin Avery (Michele Mirabella) begins to show her around the property, strange incidents begin to happen. A painter (Anthony Flees) falls off his rig and is horribly injured, coughing up blood and babbling about, \"the eyes, the eyes.\" Dr. John McCabe (David Warbeck) arrives to take the injured man to the hospital, and offers Liza some sympathy. Next, a plumber, named Joe, attempts to repair a major leak in the flooded cellar. However, he is murdered by a presence that emerged from behind a slim-caked wall. The atmosphere at the hotel is further chilled by the creepy-looking servants, Arthur (Giampaolo Saccarola) and Martha (Veronica Lazar), who apparently come with the hotel. Martha discovers Joe's dead body in the cellar, and another much older cadaver lying in a pool of dirty water nearby. It is apparently that of Schweik, the artist.Driving down the 14-mile causeway to New Orleans, Liza encounters a strange blind woman, standing in the middle of the desolate highway. The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller), and tells Liza that she has been waiting for her, although her eyes are occluded with cataracts. Liza drives Emily over to her opulently furnished house in New Orleans. Liza is warned by Emily to leave the hotel while she still can. Meanwhile at the hospital morgue, Dr. John McCabe is performing the autopsy on Joe the plumber while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) wants to install an EMG machine to the corpse of Schweik. John laughs it off and leaves for lunch, while Harris remains behind to install the EMG machine. After Harris leaves for a call, the EMG machine begins pulsing with activity. A little later, Joe's wife Mary-Anne (Laura De Marchi) arrives with her daughter Jill (Maria Pia Marsale) to dress up her husband's corpse for the funeral, when she is killed in a horrific way by scalded with acid. Jill is then menaced by the re-animated cadaver of Schweik.Liza meets with John McCabe in a downtown bar to discuss her misgivings and anxieties. He expresses puzzlement when Lisa complains about he ineptitude of her weird servants. John claims to have never heard of them before despite knowing everyone in the area. Then a phone call from the bar arrives from Harris who informs John that Mary-Anne's body was found in the morgue, while Jill was found huddled in a corner frightened and unable to speak. After Joe and Mary-Anne's funeral, Emily appears again to Liza that evening at the hotel. Emily tells Liza about the warlock Schweik, who stayed in Room 36 of the hotel and about the supernatural underworld that the hotel conceals. The hotel was built over one of the Seven Gates of Hell, and Schweik has been the Guardian. Emily is about to reveal more when her hands wander over to a canvas depicting a desolate vision of lost souls in a terrible and arid landscape. Suddenly afraid, Emily says that the painting was painted by Schweik before he died, and she runs out of the hotel parlor into the night. But Liza notices a disquieting fact about her sudden departure: Emily made no footfalls on the bare wooden boards as she ran, and neither did her seeing-eye dog.The next day, Liza ventures nervously into Room 36, a dingy phantasmal of sheet-covered furniture and shafts of dusty light.

With war threatening to tear the country asunder, a stone and anvil appear from the heavens in London town, with a sword planted firmly in the anvil. On the hilt of the sword, read the words, \"Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil is rightwise king, born of England.\" Many try to pull the sword, but none can budge it. In time, the sword is forgotten, and the Dark Ages plunge the countryside into a dismal state.Out in the woods one day, Sir Kaye is out hunting with his adopted brother Arthur, whom everyone names 'Wart.' After causing Kaye to miss shooting a deer, Arthur promises to retrieve the arrow. Arthur's journey leads him to a small hut, wherein resides a sorcerer named Merlin, and his pet owl, Archimedes, who can talk. Merlin explains to Arthur that he was expecting him to appear. After they have tea, Merlin decides to accompany Arthur back to his home, and after packing up everything in the hut into a small satchel, the two set off.Arthur and Merlin arrive at the castle of Sir Ector, where Arthur is immediately put to work in the kitchen. Merlin introduces himself to Ector, and displays his powers to the doubting Knight. After some persuasion, Ector allows Merlin to stay, putting him up in the Northwest Tower, a crumbling edifice of the castle.A few days later, Archimedes observes the arrival of Sir Pelinore, who has brought news from London of a jousting tournament to Ector and Kaye. According to the rules, the winner of the tournament will become the new King of England. Ector eagerly begins to have Kaye train, and in his excitement, promises Arthur that if he keeps working hard at his duties, he can become Kaye's squire.Merlin hears of this news, and decides to push Arthur to see his true potential (as Merlin can move into the past and the future, he knows who Arthur will become). While walking outside along the castle's moat, Merlin explains that he can turn into a fish. This idea excites Arthur, and Merline turns them both into fish, to explore the moat. However, a much larger fish soon gives chase to young Arthur, until they both manage to escape.Arthur's tardiness in helping Kaye practice results in him washing dishes. Merlin finds him, and after bewitching the dishes and washing utensils, leads Arthur into the forest, where they both are turned into squirrels by the sorcerer. As Arthur leaps among the trees, he comes across a girl squirrel, who is soon madly infatuated with him. Merlin finds the whole scenario cute, until he is soon found irresistible by another squirrel. Merlin then changes himself and Arthur back to normal. The girl squirrel who was infatuated with Arthur, skitters away, heartbroken.Arthur and Merlin return to the castle, where Ector lectures Merlin for making Arthur shirk his duties. Arthur tries to defend Merlin, but his 'mouthing off' ends causes Ector to declare that Arthur will not become Kaye's squire, and that that honor will belong to another person of the castle, who is named Hobbes.Arthur is dejected at what has happened, but Merlin tries to get him to persevere, and plans to educate Arthur. As he attempts to explain things, Archimedes interjects on Merlin's teaching methods, as Merlin is educating Arthur on things that will not be proven for hundreds of years, and could very well lead people to think of Arthur as a raving lunatic in their current Dark Ages.Exasperated at this lecturing, Merlin turns teaching duties over to Archimedes, while he fiddles with a model plane. Archimedes scoffs at the toy plane, while Merlin attempts to prove that 'man will fly.' His efforts lead to the plane plummeting like a rock to the moat below. Even though the plane's flight was a failure, Arthur tells of how he's often dreamed of soaring like a bird.

Pud comes out of the house and asks who the stranger was. Gramps is surprised and relieved that someone else could see the stranger; he was not merely a dream or apparition.\nPud tells Gramps that when he does a good deed, he will be able to make a wish. Because his apples are constantly being stolen, Gramps wishes that anyone who climbs up his apple tree will have to stay there until he permits them to climb down. Pud inadvertently tests the wish when he has trouble coming down from the tree himself, becoming free only when Gramps says he can.\nPud's busybody Aunt Demetria (Eily Malyon) has designs on Pud and the money left him by his parents. Gramps spends much time fending off her efforts to adopt the boy.\nBrink takes Granny Nellie (Beulah Bondi) in a peaceful death just after she finishes a bit of knitting. When Mr. Brink returns again for Gramps, the old man finally realizes who his visitor is. Determined not to leave Pud to Demetria, Gramps tricks Mr. Brink into climbing the apple tree. While stuck in the tree, he cannot take Gramps or anyone else. The only way anyone or anything can die is if they touch Mr. Brink or the apple tree.\nDemetria plots to have Gramps committed to a psychiatric hospital when he claims that Death is trapped in his apple tree. Gramps proves his story first by proving that his doctor, Dr. Evans (Henry Travers), can not even kill a fly they have captured.

Gramps refuses, so the doctor arranges for the local sheriff to commit Gramps while Pud is delivered to Demetria's custody.

That someone, Major Mitchell Gant USAF (Rtd) (Clint Eastwood), hears the helicopter approaching and instantly breaks into a dead run back toward his cabin, where he takes a shotgun off its rack and cocks it. As the helicopter lands, Gant lapses into a post-tramautic memory of a nightmare that he lived through in Vietnam: shot down over the North in his A-4, he was being taken to a prison camp when two Hueys machine-gunned his captors. Gant suffered personal trauma when an overflying A-4 dropped an incendiary on the site, killing a little girl who stood around too long, watching the battle. Back in the present, Captain Arthur Buckholz (David Huffman) pulls Gant out of his episode and apologizes for the surprise.The next several scenes are back-and-forth cuts between the conversation between Gant and Buckholz, and a briefing being run by Kenneth Aubrey (Freddie Jones) of the British SIS concerning the Soviet Union's latest fighter/interceptor: the Mikoyan-Gurevich \"MiG\" Model 31, given the codename \"Firefox\" by NATO. Its capabilities seem otherworldly: total stealth, twin engines each delivering 50,000 pounds of thrust, combat ceiling 100,000-feet-plus, speed in excess of Mach 5 or even Mach 6 (and able to maintain it, no small feat), and a weapons and defense system able to read the pilot's thoughts and allow him to aim and fire his weapons without even having to press a button, thus affording him a 3- to 5-second reaction-time advantage over any opponent. NATO's descision is to send Gant in to steal a Firefox prototype right off the Soviet development base at Bilyarsk near the Ural Mountains.Gant resents the operation because he is being quite simply blackmailed; he has been allowed to live on government land which now will be sold out from under him if he does not agree to the mission. The NATO Air Force attache (Thomas Hill) resents it, too, because Gant has no experience as a spy and, worse yet, is subject to post-traumatic stress disorder and may crack at any time. They use Gant for two reasons only: he speaks fluent Russian and happens to be a perfect fit for the pressure suit worn by the MiG-31's prime test pilot, Lt. Col. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff).Gant goes through several weeks of retraining, both in flying and in aerial combat, and briefings on his first required impersonation--as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, known to be smuggling heroin into the Soviet Union. After his training is over he is sent to London where Aubrey gives him his final briefing on his objectives and he's disguised with a new haircut and a false mustache. Gant is also familiarized with the underground network group, who are mostly Russian Jews. Aubrey also hands him a one-way homing device disguised as a cheap transistor radio. What his handlers don't tell him, though, is that if anything compromises the mission, Gant will be left on his own.Gant lands at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow, blusters his way through an unannounced customs search, and manages to leave the airport--with the \"radio.\" He takes a taxi to his rooms at the Hotel Moscow, puts the radio into his pocket, and waits. Outside he sees three Soviet soldiers goose-stepping in formation while patrolling.In the meantime, at KGB Moscow Center on Dzherzhinskiy Square, Colonel Kontarsky (Kenneth Colley) of the KGB finalizes his plans to safeguard the MiG-31 prior to its trials the next day which will be conducted for the Soviet First Secretary. He also orders his second-in-command, Dmitri Priabin (Oliver Cotton), to arrest some underground members at dawn, but not to move before then. Kontarsky in fact knows all about the spy network funneling information from Bilyarsk out of Russia--but even he does not know what the CIA and the SIS really have planned.That night Gant walks out to the Krasnokholmskiy Bridge, under instructions to be there at precisely 10:30 with the KGB shadowing him -- he is ordered ", "qas": [{"question": "Who refuse to kill Voskov?", "id": "2e4f24b1316749f18d5d38389c89d824", "answers": [{"answer_start": 894, "text": "Gant"}]}, {"question": "What prototype is under heavy guard?", "id": "c97a0438b5104c4dab7a6348ca171c1e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2224, "text": "MiG-31"}, {"answer_start": 1106, "text": "Firefox"}, {"answer_start": 1106, "text": "Firefox"}]}, {"question": "Who has got the wind of the operation and is already hot on Gant's tail?", "id": "0048e473297f4121a908db823526aefc", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3980, "text": "KGB"}]}, {"question": "Who engages Gant in a dogfight?", "id": "1c7afb41143f47799472a21da1415c0d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2266, "text": "Voskov"}]}, {"question": "Where is the airbase located?", "id": "0415dbb4004f4665a52f0c793e0666c7", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3769, "text": "Bilyarsk"}, {"answer_start": 3769, "text": "Bilyarsk"}]}, {"question": "Who barely reaches the Arctic ice?", "id": "287e34da316744ffaf0973177cc0b27e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 894, "text": "Gant"}]}]}]}, {"title": "On a brief trip back to London, earnest, bookish b", "paragraphs": [{"context": "On a brief trip back to London, earnest, bookish bacteriologist Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is dazzled by Kitty Garstin (Naomi Watts), a vivacious and vain London socialite.

The new mayor of the city (Kenneth Mars) assigns Captain Harris (G.W. Bailey) and Lt. Proctor (Lance Kinsey) to the case, but while on stakeout the Wilson gang manages to slip through their fingers.The Mayor wants Harris and Proctor to work with Police Academy head Commandant Lassard (George Gaynes) on apprehending the gang. Lassard assembles a seven-man team consisting of Hightower (Bubba Smith), Tackleberry (David Graf), Jones (Michael Winslow), Hooks (Marion Ramsey), Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), Fackler (Bruce Mahler), and Lassard's nephew, Nick (Matt McCoy) who transfers from Miami (in the previous film Police Acdemy 5) to the city to remain close to his friends and dull-witted uncle.After distributing flyers as to the information of the Wilson gang and getting nowhere, Nick McCoy stumbles upon a paper heading of an antique diamond heading to a museum, and gets an idea to use it as bait: however the robbers nab the diamond anyway by cutting a hole in the truck and escaping through the sewer system. McCoy then decides to go undercover to get information regarding a possible hideout, but Harris decides to go undercover to get a confession.It turns out that Harris goes undercover as a window washer at a tall building, for which he has a fear of heights, and gets a confession of himself on tape after his loyal but numb-skull lacky, Proctor, accidentally knocks him over the balcony.It is revealed here that the robberies are committed by a group of three dim-witted criminals who do not seem to be able to do this on their own, and it is revealed they are being guided by a literally shadow figure known as the \"Mastermind\", who speaks to the three behind a wall of glass and uses a voice distortion device. He devises a plan to get the cops out of the way.Commandant Lassard and his men are later suspended after stolen jewellery from the last robbery is planted in Lassard's locker, pending an investigation. The misfit cops decide to clear Lassard's name by nabbing the gang and the ringleader. Accessing data files from a computer, McCoy deduces that the robberies are occurring along a bus route, thus intentionally lowering property values in that part of the city. They also learn that someone must be 'leaking' information to the bad guys, which is why they are always one step ahead of the Police Academy.The Police Academy force finds and does battle with the Wilson gang, while Nick chases the leader. A pursuit follows, which leads to Commissioner Hurst's (George Robertson) office. It is revealed that the Mayor is the \"Mastermind\" and that Captain Harris has been unwittingly leaking information during his daily meetings with the Mayor. Hurst apologizes and reinstates the force, and a plaque is given to honor the officers' bravery the next day.As the movie closes, Harris is sitting in a chair when a string tying the balloon float is cut, lifting his chair and floating him up into the air as he shouts Proctor's name.\n\n", "qas": [{"question": "Who assigns the police to investigate the robberies?", "id": "fdb2561b4aaf488aa8dd730911b7b059", "answers": [{"answer_start": 95, "text": "mayor of the city (Kenneth Mars"}]}, {"question": "Who is revealed to be the \"Mastermind\"?", "id": "541844a0e187448998d19db853f2f273", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2630, "text": "Mayor"}]}, {"question": "who is guiding the group of three dimwitted criminals ?", "id": "2b74193b5283473c8d6fc0318ba26ebc", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1723, "text": "Mastermind"}]}, {"question": "Who does the police academy do battle with ?", "id": "c688c0dc1f8c4a4abe5025ff174bdd33", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2481, "text": "Wilson gang"}]}, {"question": "Did Nick get anywhere by distributing the flyers?", "id": "d95559caf8454658a7bef11b3aa6466c", "answers": [{"answer_start": 865, "text": "nowhere"}]}, {"question": "In whose office was stolen jewelry found?", "id": "2525ab9fac564cc1b3a27b6353bdc8df", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1978, "text": "Lassard's locker"}]}, {"question": "Who has been unwittingly leaking information during his daily meetings with the mayor?", "id": "aa4c9734dbe74318804a82daa08f87b2", "answers": [{"answer_start": 136, "text": "Captain Harris"}]}, {"question": "How does Nick find out about the diamond he uses as bait?", "id": "d8e049e65b7f4edda8f887e44e4c53ba", "answers": [{"answer_start": 901, "text": "paper"}]}, {"question": "What gang does the police academy find and do battle with?", "id": "944fce391f9b440a9b4cc44a2b792215", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2481, "text": "Wilson gang"}]}, {"question": "Who chases the leader?", "id": "bbf25c48c1454998a32209058a228999", "answers": [{"answer_start": 874, "text": "Nick"}]}, {"question": "What does Harris shout as he floats up in the air?", "id": "b2d80c4133494ee596e6e67219cc68fd", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3032, "text": "Proctor's name"}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the gang the police are looking for?", "id": "54f5ea8715d0408893b1f1201b6a6498", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2481, "text": "Wilson gang"}]}, {"question": "Who nabbed the diamond?", "id": "c60bb3a144ab4e3ca7700ac28224f8ba", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2481, "text": "Wilson gang"}]}, {"question": "Who is the mastermind ?", "id": "1c51bd10808a4504b8937920908f6703", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2630, "text": "Mayor"}]}, {"question": "What is given to honor the officers' bravery?", "id": "11136749c9b44320a080f4f50a22eb2d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2763, "text": "Hurst"}]}, {"question": "Who distributes the flyers?", "id": "bf41d077ccdb4ddca1269ba500c5f31b", "answers": [{"answer_start": 874, "text": "Nick McCoy"}]}, {"question": "Where does Nick deduce the robberies are occurring?", "id": "b95af67071d84907b8bf3a9f6b5a118f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2194, "text": "along a bus route"}]}, {"question": "What are the police investigating?", "id": "61d51cc05ac448948d09821b5b914ea3", "answers": [{"answer_start": 32, "text": "series of robberies"}]}, {"question": "What are the police assigned to investigate?", "id": "b15b8b2b09004bcc915e0ce657bf316d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2170, "text": "robberies"}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the gang Nick is trying to take down?", "id": "973e8e8403ac4946bce30fb5e5aa6000", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2481, "text": "Wilson gang"}]}, {"question": "What is given to honor the officers bravery the next day ?", "id": "bc0097fe33a4472e91ac2c6a8acd8bb8", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2812, "text": "plaque"}]}, {"question": "What does Nick get an idea to use the diamond as?", "id": "261b0cf50dd64b979796b390e48d927d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 988, "text": "bait"}]}]}]}, {"title": "\n\nThe film begins some years in the future from th", "paragraphs": [{"context": "\n\nThe film begins some years in the future from this exact moment. We see ads everywhere (buildings, walls, bus stops, e.t.c) for the hit game Slayers, and how the star character Kable (Gerard Butler) has four battles left before he earns his freedom. We are then shown a battle in progress: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters get points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17-year-old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays/controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterward, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don't believe that anyone will be released from the game.The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the show - genius recluse Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one has ever survived that long). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre-engineered actions to do, and will be set free if they survive just one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high). Also, the games are all televised on pay-per-view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano-cells implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their control back).After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that eventually we will all be his slaves if we continue down this road. Castle gets a kick out of it and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. He talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sits by himself and is constantly thinking. He can't believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him why he's in prison. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a room. Later on, while sitting in his cell, someone opens the slot of the door and hands Kable a picture of his wife and child. The female voice on the other side knows that his family is the only thing he fights for. She makes Kable sign an autograph for her son, David, and then takes a blood sample from his hand as proof of authenticity to increase the value of the autograph.Elsewhere, we see Kable's wife Angie (Amber Valletta) going to work as a character in Society.

After 2E leaves, Holly enters Paul's apartment and learns that he is a writer who has not had anything published since a book of vignettes five years before. Holly, in turn, explains that she is trying to save money to support her brother Fred when he gets out of the Army. The pair fall asleep, but are awakened when Holly has a nightmare about Fred.

Peggy disdainfully tosses the card in the trash and gives the flowers to a woman selling cheap gardenias.Soon after, the flight gets ready to leave and we are introduced to Professor and Mrs. Spengler, an elderly couple, and Joe, the flight's co-pilot, who is immediately attracted to Alice.

Peggy comes up to the cockpit to visit with Bill, whose rudeness finally makes it clear that he wants nothing to do with her.

Though the film's symbolism is open to interpretation, the wall itself clearly reflects a sense of isolation and alienation.Pink (Bob Geldof), the protagonist (and unreliable narrator) of the film, is a rock star, one of several reasons behind his apparent depressive and detached emotional state. He is first seen in a quiet hotel room, having trashed it. The opening music is not by Pink Floyd, but is the Vera Lynn recording of \"The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot\". During the following scenes, it is revealed that Pink's father, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pink's infancy. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters' real-life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who died in combat in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944.The movie then flashes back to Pink as a young English boy growing up in the early 1950s. Throughout his childhood, Pink longs for a father figure after he learns his father died in the war. At school, he is humiliated by his mean and stern teacher for writing poems in class. The poems that the teacher seizes from him and reads aloud are lyrics from \"Money\" from the Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon. Pink is also affected by his overprotective mother who spoils him by giving him whatever he wants.As an adult, Pink eventually gets married as his fame as a rock star grows, but he and his wife grow apart and she has an affair while Pink is on tour. When Pink learns of the affair, he compensates with expensive materialistic possessions and turns to a willing groupie (Jenny Wright), whom he brings back to his hotel room only to trash it in a fit of violence, causing her to flee the room in terror.Pink slowly begins to lose his mind to metaphorical \"worms\". He shaves off all of his body hair (an incident inspired by former bandmate Syd Barrett, who appeared at a 1975 recording session of Wish You Were Here, having shaved his eyebrows and body hair) and, while watching The Dam Busters on television, morphs into his neo-Nazi alter-ego. Pink's manager (Bob Hoskins), along with the hotel manager (Michael Ensign) and some paramedics, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him away into a waiting limousine outside the hotel and inject him with drugs to enable him to perform.The drugs cause Pink to hallucinate and he fantasises that he is a neo-Nazi dictator, his concert is a rally. His followers proceed to attack ethnic minorities and rape the white girlfriend of a black man. Later, Pink holds a rally in suburban London, singing \"Waiting for the Worms\". The scene is inter-cut by images of animated marching hammers that goose-step across ruins.Pink screams \"Stop!\" and takes refuge in a bathroom stall at the concert venue, reciting poems which would later be used as lyrics on Pink Floyd's \"Your Possible Pasts\" from The Final Cut album and \"5:11 AM (The Moment Of Clarity)\" from Roger Waters' The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking.In a climatic animated sequence, Pink puts himself on trial. He is depicted as a small, pink rag doll that rarely moves. The judge is a giant pair of buttocks, with two backward facing legs, an anus for a mouth and a scrotum for a chin.

Following instructions from a mysterious man named Dane, she eventually ends up in Los Angeles.One night, while giving a lecture to an audience of people with whom she hopes to convince that vampires exist and aware that they attend when she speaks, she activates overhead ultraviolet lamps that incinerate several of the vampires in the audience before the humans. She is quickly arrested and harassed by a man named FBI Agent Norris whom she quickly learns that he is a 'familiar' (bug-eater) one of the many thousands of human followers of the vampires all over the world, placed to keep their activities covered up. After they release her from custody with a warning to keep quiet about the existence of vampires, she returns to her hotel room to find three people waiting for her; Paul (Rhys Coiro), Amber (Diora Baird) and Todd (Harold Perrineau) who had been sent by Dane to collect her in order to hunt down the vampire queen Lilith, whom they are convinced once out of the way, the vampires will fall into more-or-less form of dormancy as she is responsible for their every move and for keeping them hidden, when Stella asks if she is responsible for the incident at Barrow and is notified that she was.

The old woman names the girl Thumbelina and raises her as her own.\nAlthough Thumbelina loves her mother, she craves companionship from someone her own size. One night, Cornelius, the fairy prince, stumbles upon Thumbelina after hearing her beautiful singing. The two take a ride on Cornelius' bumblebee, and fall in love; during this ride Mrs. Toad and her son Grundel are enchanted by Thumbelina's singing. Cornelius promises to return the next day, but after he's gone, Mrs. Toad kidnaps Thumbelina from her bed and takes her away.\nThumbelina awakens on Mrs. Toad's show boat. Mrs. Toad wants Thumbelina to join their troupe and marry Grundel, who is in love with her. They leave Thumbelina alone on a lily pad in order to fetch a priest, but a friendly swallow, Jacquimo (the narrator of the film), overhears Thumbelina's cries for help and frees her. Jacquimo's friends, the jitterbugs, promise to help Thumbelina get home safely while Jacquimo sets off to find Cornelius. Meanwhile, Cornelius learns of Thumbelina's kidnapping and ventures out to find her.\nWhile trying to get home, Thumbelina is ambushed by Berkeley Beetle, who scares the jitterbugs away. He is enamoured with her singing, and promises to show her the way home if she sings at his Beetle Ball first. Thumbelina agrees, but when she's received poorly at the Beetle Ball, Beetle kicks her out without helping her.\nWinter is approaching. Jacquimo accidentally impales his wing on a thorn and is knocked out by the cold, while Cornelius falls into a lake and is frozen in ice. Grundel, who is searching for Thumbelina, finds Beetle and discovers she is in love with Prince Cornelius and upon some convincing from Beetle, decides to find and kidnap Cornelius to lure Thumbelina to him. Grundel forces Beetle to help him as Grundel steals his wings and won't return them until Beetle has found and captured Cornelius.\nThumbelina is taken in by Miss Fieldmouse, who tells her that Cornelius has died. The two visit Miss Fieldmouse's neighbor, Mr. Mole who tells them about a dead bird he found in his tunnel earlier that day. It turns out to be Jacquimo, who Thumbelina discovers to be only unconscious. Mr. Mole wishes to marry Thumbelina; heartbroken over Cornelius's death, Thumbelina accepts. Jacquimo awakens under Thumbelina's care and leaves to find Cornelius, refusing to believe that he is dead. Meanwhile, Beetle brings Cornelius's frozen body to Grundel and informs him that Thumbelina is going to marry the Mole. After the two leave to stop the wedding, the young jitterbugs thaw Cornelius's body out.\nAt the wedding, Thumbelina realizes at the last moment that she can't marry someone she does not love and refuses to take the vows. Grundel and Beetle crash the wedding, but Thumbelina flees from them and Mr. Mole. Cornelius intercepts the crowd and confronts Grundel, the ensuing fight resulting in them both falling into an abyss. Once outside and free, Thumbelina is reunited with Jacquimo, who takes her to Cornelius' kingdom, the Vale of the Fairies. Cornelius appears, having survived the fall, the pair are reunited, and Thumbelina accepts his proposal of marriage. The two kiss, and Thumbelina is granted her own wings.\nWith Thumbelina's mother and the fairy court in attendance, Thumbelina and Cornelius are married and depart on their honeymoon on Cornelius's bumblebee.

Demetria plots to take Gramps committed to a psychiatric hospital when he claims that Death is trapped in his apple tree. Gramps proves his story first by proving that his doctor, Dr. Evans (Henry Travers ), can not even kill a fly front they have captured. He offers further proof of his power by shooting Mr. Grimes (Nat Pendleton ), the orderly who has come to take him to the asylum; Grimes lives when he should have died. Dr. Evans is now a believer, but he tries to convince Gramps to let Death down so people who constitute suffering can find release. Gramps refuses, so the doctor arranges for the local sheriff to commit Gramps while Pudding is delivered to Demetria ' siemens custody. With the assistance of his housekeeper (Una Merkel ), Gramps tricks both of them into believing they are scheduled to go with Mr. Brink when he come down from the tree. They beg Gramps to convince Brink otherwise, and Demetria vows never to bother Gramps or Pud again. Gramps realizes that sooner or later he will have to let Brinks down\u00e2 \u0080 \u0094 Death is an ultimately unavoidable part of life story. He tries to say goodbye to Pud, who reacts angrily and tries to run away. Mr. Brink sees Pudding in the yard and make bold him to climb the tree. Pud gets over the fence Gramps has had built around the tree, but falls and is crippled for life. Distraught, Gramps lets Decease down from the tree diagram.

That someone, Major Mitchell Gant USAF (Rtd) (Clint Eastwood ), hears the helicopter approaching and instantly break into a dead run back toward his cabin, where he takes a shotgun off its rack and cocks it. As the helicopter lands, Gant lapses into a post - tramautic memory of a nightmare that he lived through in Vietnam: shot down over the North in his A - 4, he was being taken to a prison camp when two Hueys machine - gunned his captor. Gant suffered personal trauma when an overflying A - 4 dropped an incendiary on the site, killing a little girl who stand around too long, watching the battle. Back in the present, Skipper Arthur Buckholz (David Huffman) pulls Gant out of his episode and apologizes for the surprise. The next several scenes are back - and - forth cuts between the conversation between Gant and Buckholz, and a briefing being run by Kenneth Aubrey (Freddie Jones) of the British SIS concerning the Soviet Union ' s latest fighter / interceptor: the Mikoyan - Gurevich \" MiG \" Model 31, given the codename \" Firefox \" by NATO. Its capabilities seem otherworldly: total stealth, twin engines each delivering l, 000 pounds of thrust, combat ceiling 100, 000 - feet - plus, speed in excess of Mach 5 or even Mach 6 (and able to maintain it, no small feat ), and a weapons and defense system able to read the pilot ' s thoughts and allow him to direct and fire his weapons without even having to press a button, thus affording him a 3 - to 5 - second reaction - time advantage over any opponent. NATO ' s descision is to send Gant in to steal a Firefox prototype right off the Soviet development base at Bilyarsk near the Ural Mountains. Gant resents the operation because he is being quite simply blackmailed; he has been allowed to live on government land which now will be sold out from under him if he does not agree to the mission. The NATO Air Force attache (Thomas Hill) resents it, too, because Gant has no experience as a spy and, worse yet, equal open to post - traumatic stress disorder and may crack at any time. They use Gant for two reasons only: he speaks fluent Russian and happens to be a perfect fit for the pressure suit worn by the MiG - 31 ' s prime test pilot, Lt. Gap. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff ). Gant goes through several weeks of retraining, both in flying and in ethereal combat, and briefings on his first required impersonation - - as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, known to comprise smuggling heroin into the Soviet Union. After his education is over he is sent to London where Aubrey gives him his final briefing on his objectives and he ' s disguised with a new haircut and a false mustache. Gant is also familiarized with the underground network group, who are mostly Russian Jews. Aubrey also hands him a one - way homing device disguised as a cheap transistor wireless. What his handlers don ' t tell him, though, is that if anything compromises the mission, Gant will be left on his own. Gant lands at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow, blusters his way through an unannounced customs search, and manages to leave the airport - - with the \" radio. \" He takes a taxi to his suite at the Hotel Moscow, puts the radio into his pocket, and waits. Outside he sees three Soviet soldiers goose - stepping in formation while patrolling. In the meantime, at KGB Moscow Center on Dzherzhinskiy Square, Colonel Kontarsky (Kenneth Colley) of the soviet kgb finalizes his plans to safeguard the MiG - 31 prior to its trials the next day which will be conducted for the Soviet First Secretary. He also orders his second - in - command, Dmitri Priabin (Oliver Cotton ), to arrest some underground members at dawn, but not to move before then.

Lassard assembles a seven - man squad consisting of Hightower (Bubba Smith ), Tackleberry (David Graf ), Jones (Michael Winslow ), Claw (Marion Ramsey ), Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook ), Fackler (Bruce Mahler ), and Lassard ' s nephew, Nick (Matt McCoy) who transfers from Miami (in the previous film Police Acdemy 5) to the city to remain close to his friends and dull - witted uncle.

We see ads everywhere (buildings, walls, bus stops, e. t. c) for the hit game Slayers, and how the star eccentric Kable (Gerard Samuel butler) has four battles left before he earns his freedom. We are then shown a battle in progress: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters get points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17 - year - old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays / controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable get blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterward, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now only has three battles left until exemption. Some of the other characters don ' t believe that anyone will be released from the game. The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their adjacent guest for the show - adept recluse Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall ). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can capture paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castling created Slayers, a controversial game which be supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay live for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one has ever survived that long ). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre - engineered actions to do, and will personify set free if they survive just one conflict, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high ). Also, the games are all televised on pay - per - view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano - cells implanted into their brains, which makes information technology possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their control back ). After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that eventually we will all be his slaves if we proceed down this road. Castle gets a kick out of it and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. He talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sits by himself and is constantly thinking. He can ' t believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him why he ' s in prison. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a room.

We see ads everywhere (buildings, walls, bus stops, e. t. c) for the hit game Slayers, and how the star character Kable (Gerard Butler) has four battles left before he earns his freedom. We are then shown a battle in progress: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters get points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17 - year - old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays / controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the conflict. Afterward, the come through characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don ' t believe that anyone bequeath be released from the game. The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the show - genius recluse Ken Castling, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Radclyffe hall ). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can bugger off paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death quarrel inmates who chose to sign up for the plot instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one has of all time survived that long ). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre - engineered actions to do, and will be set free if they survive just one battle, but are ineffectual to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high ). Also, the games are all televised on pay - per - view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano - cells implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game live over, they get their controller back ). After the display is over, the signaling is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that finally we will all be his slaves if we continue down this road. Castle gets a kick out of it and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to miss only in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. He talks astir how Kable spooks everyone else when he sits by himself and is constantly thinking. He can ' t believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him why he ' s in prison. Kable has a quick flashback of a man hemorrhage in a room. Later on, while sitting in his cell, someone opens the slot of the door and hands Kable a picture of his wife and child. The female voice on the other side knows that his family is the only thing he fight down for. She makes Kable sign an autograph for her son, Saint david, and then takes a blood sample from his hand as proof of authenticity to increase the value of the autograph.

Though the film ' s symbolism is open to interpretation, the wall itself clearly reflects a sense of closing off and alienation. Pink (Bob Geldof ), the protagonist (and unreliable narrator) of the film, is a rock star, one of several reasons behind his apparent depressive and detached emotional state. He is first seen in a still hotel room, having trashed it. The opening music is not by Pink Floyd, but is the Vera Lynn recording of \" The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot \". During the following scenes, it is revealed that Pink ' s father, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pink ' s infancy. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters ' real - life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who died in combat in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944. The movie then flashes back to Pink as a young English boy growing up in the early 1950s. Throughout his childhood, Pink longs for a father figure after he learn his father died in the war. At school, he is humiliated by his mean and severe teacher for writing poems in year. The poem that the teacher appropriate from him and reads aloud are lyrics from \" Money \" from the Pink Floyd record album Dark Side of the Moon. Pink is also affected by his overprotective mother who spoils him by giving him whatever he wants. As an adult, Pink eventually gets married as his fame as a rock star grows, but helium and his wife grow apart and she has an affair while Pink is on tour. When Pink learns of the affair, he compensates with expensive materialistic possessions and turns to a willing groupie (Jenny Wright ), whom he brings back to his hotel room only to trash it in a fit of violence, causing her to flee the room in terror. Pink slowly begins to lose his mind to metaphorical \" worms \". He shaves off all of his body hair (an incident inspired by former bandmate Syd Barrett, who appeared at a 1975 recording session of Wish You Were Here, having shaved his supercilium and body haircloth) and, while watching The Dyke Busters on television, morphs into his neo - Nazi alter - ego. Pink ' s manager (Bob Hoskins ), along with the hotel manager (Michael Ensign) and some paramedic, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him away into a waiting limousine outside the hotel and inject him with drugs to enable him to do. The drugs cause Pink to hallucinate and he fantasises that he is a neo - Nazi authoritarian, his concert represent a rally. His followers proceed to attack ethnic minorities and rape the white girlfriend of a black man. Later, Pink holds a rally in suburban London, singing \" Waiting for the Worms \". The scene is inter - cut by images of animated marching hammer that goose - step across ruins. Pink screams \" Stop! \" and takes refuge in a bathroom stall at the concert venue, reciting poems which would later be used as lyrics on Pink Floyd ' s \" Your Possible Pasts \" from The Final Cut album and \" 5: eleven AM (The Moment Of Clarity) \" from Roger Waters ' The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. In a climatic animated sequence, Pink puts himself on trial. He is depicted as a small, pink rag doll that rarely moves. The judge is a giant pair of stern, with two backward facing legs, an anus for a mouth and a scrotum for a chin. The attorney is a tall, menacing, vulturelike man and the schoolmaster is an abusive, hateful marionette. After hearing from the parties and witnesses (Pink ' s wife and female parent ), the judge orders the wall to personify torn down. The wall explodes and shows a montage of events from the entire film. The film concludes with three children cleaning up a pile of debris after an earlier riot.

According to the rules, the winner of the tournament will become the new King of England. Ector eagerly begins to have Kaye train, and in his excitement, promises Arthur that if he keeps working hard at his duties, he can become Kaye ' s squire. Merlin hears of this news, and decides to push Arthur to insure his straight potential (as Merlin can move into the past and the future, helium knows who Arthur will become ). While walking outside along the castle ' s moat, Merlin explains that he can turn into a fish. This idea excites Arthur, and Merline turns them both into fish, to search the moat. However, a much larger fish soon gives chase to young Arthur, until they both manage to escape. Arthur ' s tardiness in helping Kaye practice results in him washing dishes. Merlin finds him, and after bewitching the dishes and washing utensils, leads Arthur into the forest, where they both are turned into squirrels by the sorcerer. As Arthur leaps among the trees, he comes across a girl squirrel, who is soon madly infatuated with him. Merlin finds the whole scenario cute, until he is soon discover irresistible by another squirrel. Merlin then changes himself and Arthur back to normal. The girl squirrel who was infatuated with Arthur, skitters away, heartbroken. Arthur and Merlin return to the castle, where Ector lectures Merlin for making Arthur shirk his duties. Arthur tries to defend Merlin, only his ' mouthing off ' ends causes Ector to declare that Arthur will not become Kaye ' s squire, and that that honor will belong to another person of the castle, who is named Hobbes. Arthur is dejected at what has happened, but Falco columbarius tries to get him to persevere, and plans to educate Arthur. As he attempts to explain things, Archimedes interjects on Merlin ' s teaching methods, as Merlin is educating Arthur on things that will not be proven for hundreds of years, and could very well lead people to think of Arthur as a raving lunatic in their current Dark Ages. Exasperated at this lecturing, Merlin turns teaching duties over to Archimedes, while he fiddles with a model plane. Archimedes scoffs at the toy plane, while Merlin attempts to prove that ' man will fly. ' His efforts lead to the plane plummeting like a rock to the moat below. Even though the planer ' s flight was a failure, Arthur tells of how he ' s often dreamed of soaring like a bird.

That someone, John major Mitchell Gant USAF (Rtd) (Clint Eastwood ), hears the helicopter approaching and instantly breaks into a dead run back toward his cabin, where he takes a shotgun off its rack and cocks it. As the helicopter lands, Gant lapses into a post - tramautic memory of a nightmare that he lived through in Vietnam: shot down over the North in his A - 4, he was being taken to a prison house camp when two Hueys machine - gunned his captors. Gant suffered personal trauma when an overflying A - 4 dropped an incendiary on the site, killing a little girl who stood around too long, watching the battle. Back in the present, Captain Arthur Buckholz (David Huffman) pulls Gant out of his episode and apologizes for the surprisal. The next several scenes are backward - and - forth cuts between the conversation between Gant and Buckholz, and a briefing being run by Kenneth Aubrey (Freddie Jones) of the British SIS concerning the Soviet Union ' s latest fighter / interceptor: the Mikoyan - Gurevich \" MiG \" Model 31, given the codename \" Firefox \" by NATO. Its capabilities seem otherworldly: total stealing, twin engines each delivering 50, 000 pounds of thrust, combat ceiling 100, 000 - feet - plus, speed in excess of Mach 5 or even Mach 6 (and able to maintain it, no small feat ), and a weapons and defense system able to read the pilot ' s thoughts and allow him to aim and fire his weapons without even having to press a button, thus affording him a 3 - to 5 - second reaction - time advantage over any opponent. NATO ' s descision is to send Gant in to steal a Firefox prototype right off the Soviet development base at Bilyarsk near the Ural Mountains. Gant resents the operation because he is being quite simply blackmailed; he has been allowed to live on government land which now will be sold stunned from under him if he does not agree to the mission. The NATO Air Force attache (Thomas Hill) resents it, too, because Gant has no experience as a spy and, worse yet, is subject to post - traumatic stress disorder and english hawthorn crack at any time. They use Gant for 2 reasons only: he speaks fluent Russian and happens to be a perfect fit for the force per unit area suit worn by the MiG - xxxi ' s prime test pilot, Lt. Col. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff ). Gant goes through with several weeks of retraining, both in flying and in aerial combat, and briefings on his first required impersonation - - as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, known to be smuggling heroin into the Soviet Jointure. After his training is over he is sent to London where Aubrey gives him his final briefing on his objectives and he ' s disguised with a new haircut and a false mustache. Gant is also familiarized with the underground network group, who are mostly Russian Jews. Aubrey also hands him a one - way homing device disguised as a cheap transistor radio. What his handlers don ' t tell him, though, is that if anything compromises the mission, Gant will be left on his own. Gant lands at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow, blusters his way through an unannounced customs search, and manages to leave the airport - - with the \" radio. \" He pack a taxi to his rooms at the Hotel Moscow, puts the radio into his pocket, and waits. Outside he sees three Soviet soldiers goose - stepping in formation while patrolling. In the meantime, at KGB Moscow Center on Dzherzhinskiy Square, Colonel Kontarsky (Kenneth Colley) of the KGB finalizes his plans to safeguard the MiG - 31 prior to its trials the next day which will be conducted for the Soviet First Secretary. He as well orders his second - in - command, Dmitri Priabin (Oliver Cotton ), to contain some underground members at dawn, but not to move before then.

We see ads everywhere (buildings, walls, bus stop, e. t. c) for the hit game Slayers, and how the star character Kable (Gerard Butler) has four battles left before he earns his freedom. We are then shown a battle in progress: a massive gunfight inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters get points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, on the face of it unaware of all the violence around them. 17 - year - old Simon (Logan Lerman) dally / controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the conflict. Afterward, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don ' t believe that anyone will be loose from the biz. The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the show - genius recluse Sight Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall ). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, ca ca Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one has ever survived that long ). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre - engineered military action to do, and will be set free if they survive just one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high ). Also, the games are all televised on salary - per - view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano - cubicle implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (mean after the game is over, they get their control back ). After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that finally we will all be his slaves if we continue down this road. Castle gets a bang out of it and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. He talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sits by himself and is constantly thinking. He can ' t believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him wherefore he ' s in prison house. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a room. Later on, while sitting in his cell, someone opens the slot of the door and give Kable a impression of his wife and child. The female voice on the other side knows that his family is the only affair he fights for. She makes Kable sign an autograph for her son, David, and then takes a blood sample from his hand as proof of authenticity to increase the value of the autograph.

The next several scenes are back - and - forth cuts between the conversation between Gant and Buckholz, and a briefing being run by Kenneth Aubrey (Freddie Jones) of the British SIS concerning the Soviet Union ' second latest fighter / interceptor: the Mikoyan - Gurevich \" MiG \" Model 31, given the codename \" Firefox \" by NATO. Its capabilities seem otherworldly: total stealth, twin engines each delivering 50, 000 pounds of thrust, combat ceiling c, 000 - feet - plus, speed in excess of Mach 5 or even Mach 6 (and able to maintain it, no small feat ), and a weapons and defense system able to read the pilot ' s thoughts and allow him to aim and fire his weapons without even having to press a button, thence affording him a 3 - to 5 - second reaction - time advantage over any opponent. NATO ' s descision is to send Gant in to steal a Firefox prototype right off the Soviet development base at Bilyarsk near the Ural Mountains. Gant resents the operation because he follow be quite simply blackmailed; he has been allowed to live on government land which now will be sold out from under him if he does not agree to the mission. The NATO Air Force attache (Thomas Alfred hawthorne) resents it, too, because Gant has no experience as a spy and, worse yet, is dependent to post - traumatic stress disorder and may crack at any time. They use Gant for two reasons only: he speaks fluent Russian and happens to be a perfect fit for the pressure suit worn by the MiG - 31 ' s prime trial run pilot, Lt. Col. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff ). Gant goes through several weeks of retraining, both in flying and in aerial combat, and briefings on his first required impersonation - - as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, known to be smuggling heroin into the Soviet Union. After his training is over he is sent to London where Aubrey move over him his final briefing on his objectives and he ' s disguised with a new haircut and a false mustache.

We are then shown a battle in advance: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters get points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17 - year - old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays / controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterward, the surviving fictional character are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now only receive three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don ' t believe that anyone will be released from the game. The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the show - genius recluse Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall ). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can make them make whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can make paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayer, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of do their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for xxx conflict, they will be set free (though no one has ever survived that long ). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre - engineered actions to do, and will be set free if they survive just one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high ). Also, the games are all televised on pay - per - view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano - cells implanted into their psyche, which makes information technology possible for them to be keep in line by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their control back ). After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemn Castle and states that eventually we will all be his slaves if we continue down this road. Castle fetch a kick out of it and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and thinks astir his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. He talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sits by himself and is constantly thinking. He can ' t believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him why he ' s in prison. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a room. Later on, while sitting in his cell, someone opens the slot of the door and hands Kable a picture of his wife and child. The female voice on the other side knows that his family is the only thing he fights for.

Though the film ' s symbolism is open to interpretation, the wall itself clearly reflects a sense of isolation and alienation. Pink (Bob Geldof ), the protagonist (and unreliable narrator) of the film, be a rock star, one of several reasons behind his apparent depressive and detached emotional state. He is first seen in a quiet hotel room, having trashed it. The opening music cost not by Pink Floyd, but is the Vera Lynn recording of \" The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot \". During the following scenes, it is revealed that Pink ' s father, a British soldier, was killed in natural action during World War II during Pink ' s infancy. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters ' real - life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who died in combat in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in Feb 1944. The movie then flashes back to Pink as a untried English boy growing up in the early 1950s. Throughout his childhood, Pink longs for a father figure after he learns his father died in the war. At school, helium is humiliated by his mean and stern teacher for writing poems in class. The poems that the teacher seizes from him and reads aloud are lyrics from \" Money \" from the Garden pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon. Pink is also affected by his overprotective mother who spoils him by giving him whatever he wants. As an adult, Pink eventually gets married as his fame as a rock star grows, but he and his married woman grow apart and she has an liaison while Pink is on tour. When Garden pink learns of the affair, he compensates with expensive materialistic self control and turns to a uncoerced groupie (Jenny Wright ), whom he brings back to his hotel room only to trash it in a fit of violence, causing her to flee the room in terror. Pink slowly begins to lose his mind to metaphorical \" worms \". He shaves off all of his body pilus (an incident inspired by former bandmate Syd Barrett, who appeared at a 1975 recording session of Wish You Were Here, having shaved his eyebrows and body hair) and, while watching The Dam Busters on television, morphs into his neo - Nazi alter - self. Pink ' s manager (Bob Hoskins ), along with the hotel managing director (Michael Ensign) and some paramedics, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him away into a waiting limousine outside the hotel and inject him with drugs to enable him to perform. The drugs cause Pink to hallucinate and he fantasises that he is a neo - Nazi dictator, his concert is a rally. His followers proceed to attack ethnic minorities and rape the white girlfriend of a black man. Later, Pink holds a rallying in suburban London, singing \" Waiting for the Worms \". The scene is inter - cut by images of animated marching hammers that goose - step across ruins. Pink screams \" Stop! \" and takes refuge in a bathroom stall at the concert venue, reciting poems which would later be used as lyrics on Pink Floyd ' s \" Your Possible Pasts \" from The Final Gash album and \" 5: 11 AM (The Moment Of Clarity) \" from Roger Waters ' The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. In a climatic animated sequence, Pink puts himself on trial. He is depicted as a little, pink rag doll that rarely moves. The justice is a giant pair of tail end, with two backward facing legs, an anus for a mouth and a scrotum for a chin. The lawyer is a tall, menacing, vulturelike man and the schoolmaster is an abusive, hateful marionette. After hearing from the parties and witnesses (Pink ' s wife and mother ), the judge orders the wall to be torn down. The wall explodes and shows a montage of events from the entire film.

Characters get points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17 - year - old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays / controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle.

You can devote to curb someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely pop and profitable, cause Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will represent set free (though no one has ever survived that long ). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre - engineered natural process to do, and will be set free if they survive simply one battle, but be unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high ). Also, the games are all televised on pay - per - view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano - cells implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their control back ). After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that eventually we volition all be his slaves if we continue down this road. Castle gets a kick out of it and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fails.

As the helicopter lands, Gant lapses into a post - tramautic memory of a nightmare that he lived through in Vietnam: shot down over the North in his Angstrom unit - 4, he was being taken to a prison camp when two Hueys machine - gunned his captors. Gant suffered personal trauma when an overflying A - 4 dropped an incendiary on the site, killing a little girl who stood around as well long, watching the battle.

NATO ' s descision is to send Gant in to steal a Firefox prototype right off the Soviet development base at Bilyarsk near the Ural Mountains. Gant resents the operation because he live being quite simply blackmailed; he has personify allowed to live on government land which now will be sold out from under him if he does not agree to the mission. The NATO Air Force attache (Thomas Hill) resents it, too, because Gant has no experience as a spy and, worse yet, is subject to post - traumatic stress disorder and may crack at any time. They use Gant for two reasons only: he speaks fluent Russian and happens to be a perfect fit for the pressure suit worn by the MiG - 31 ' s prime test pilot, Lt. Col. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff ). Gant goes through several weeks of retraining, both in flying and in aerial combat, and briefings on his first required impersonation - - as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, known to be smuggling heroin into the Soviet Conglutination. After his training is over he is sent to London where Aubrey gives him his final briefing on his objectives and he ' s disguised with a new haircut and a false mustache. Gant is also familiarized with the underground network group, who are mostly Russian Jews. Aubrey also hands him a one - way homing device disguised as a chintzy transistor radio.

We see ads everywhere (buildings, walls, bus stops, e. t. c) for the hit game Slayers, and how the star character Kable (Gerard Butler) has four battles left before he earns his freedom. We are then shown a battle in progress: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters let points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17 - year - old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays / controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable acquire blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterward, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now but experience three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don ' t believe that anyone will be released from the game. The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the show - genius recluse Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall ). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims plot but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial biz which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will follow set free (though no one has ever survived that long ). Some convicts are sent into battleground with pre - engineered natural action to serve, and will be set free if they survive just one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high ). Also, the games are all televised on pay - per - view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano - cells implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only represent controlled in the perimeter of the biz (meaning after the game is over, they get their control rearwards ). After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that eventually we will all be his slaves if we continue down this road. Castle gets a kick out of it and has his men try to place where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fail. Kable sits by himself and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sit down next to Kable. He talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sits by himself and is always thinking. He can ' t believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek ask him why he ' s in prison. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a room. Later on, while sitting in his cell, someone opens the slot of the door and hands Kable a word picture of his wife and child. The female voice on the other side knows that his family is the only affair he fights for. She makes Kable sign an autograph for her son, David, and then takes a blood sample from his hand as proof of authenticity to increase the value of the john hancock.

He is first seen in a quiet hotel room, having trashed it. The opening music is not by Pink Floyd, but is the Vera Lynn recording of \" The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot \". During the following scenes, it is revealed that Pink ' s padre, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pink ' s infancy. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters ' real - life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who died in combat in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944.

Pink ' s manager (Bob Hoskins ), along with the hotel manager (Michael Ensign) and some paramedics, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him away into a waiting limousine outside the hotel and inject him with drugs to enable him to perform. The drugs cause Pink to hallucinate and he fantasy that he is a neo - Nazi dictator, his concert is a rally.

In a climatic animated sequence, Pink puts himself on trial. He is depicted as a small, pink rag doll that seldom moves.

The lawyer is a tall, menacing, vulturelike man and the schoolmaster is an abusive, hateful marionette.

That someone, Major Mitchell Gant USAF (Rtd) (Clint Eastwood ), hears the helicopter approaching and instantly discover into a dead run back toward his cabin, where he takes a shotgun off its rack and cocks it. As the helicopter lands, Gant lapses into a post - tramautic memory of a nightmare that he lived through in Vietnam: shot down over the North in his A - 4, he was being taken to a prison camp when two Hueys machine - gunned his captors. Gant suffered personal trauma when an overflying A - 4 dropped an incendiary on the site, killing a little girl who stood around too long, watching the battle. Back in the present, Captain Arthur Buckholz (David Huffman) pulls Gant out of his episode and apologizes for the surprise. The next several scenes are back - and - forth cuts between the conversation between Gant and Buckholz, and a briefing being run by Kenneth Aubrey (Freddie Jones) of the British SIS concerning the Soviet Union ' s latest fighter / interceptor: the Mikoyan - Gurevich \" MiG \" Model 31, given the codename \" Firefox \" by NATO. Its capabilities seem otherworldly: total stealth, twin engines each delivering 50, 000 pounds of thrust, combat ceiling 100, 000 - ft - plus, speed in excess of Mach 5 or even Mach 6 (and able to maintain it, no small feat ), and a weapons and defense system able to read the pilot ' s thoughts and allow him to aim and fire his weapons without even having to press a button, thus affording him a 3 - to 5 - second reaction - time advantage over any opponent. NATO ' s descision is to send Gant in to steal a Firefox prototype right off the Soviet development base at Bilyarsk near the Ural Mountains. Gant resents the operation because atomic number 2 is being quite simply blackmailed; he has been allowed to live on government land which now will be sold out from under him if he does not agree to the mission. The NATO Air Force attache (Thomas Hill) resents it, too, because Gant has no experience as a spy and, worse yet, is capable to post - traumatic stress disorder and may crack at any clip. They use Gant for two reasons only: he speaks smooth spoken Russian and happens to be a perfect fit for the pressure suit worn by the MiG - 31 ' s prime test pilot, Lt. Col. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff ). Gant goes through several weeks of retraining, both in flying and in aerial fight, and briefings on his 1st required impersonation - - as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, known to be smuggling heroin into the Soviet Union. After his training is over he is sent to London where Aubrey gives him his final briefing on his object glass and he ' s disguised with a new haircut and a false mustache. Gant is also familiarized with the underground network group, who are mostly Russian Jews. Aubrey also hands him a one - way homing twist disguised as a cheap transistor radio. What his handlers don ' t tell him, though, is that if anything compromises the missionary station, Gant will be left on his own. Gant lands at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow, blusters his way through an unannounced customs search, and manages to leave the airport - - with the \" radio. \" He takes a taxi to his rooms at the Hotel Moscow, puts the radio into his pocket, and waits. Outside he sees three Soviet soldiers goose - stepping in formation while patrolling. In the meantime, at KGB Moscow Center on Dzherzhinskiy Square, Colonel Kontarsky (Kenneth Colley) of the KGB finalizes his plans to safeguard the MiG - 31 prior to its trials the next day which will be conducted for the Soviet First Secretary. He also orders his second - in - command, Dmitri Priabin (Oliver Cotton ), to arrest some underground members at dawn, but not to move before then. Kontarsky in fact knows all about the spy network funneling information from Bilyarsk out of Russia - - but even he does not know what the central intelligence agency and the SIS really possess planned.

Lassard assembles a seven - man team consisting of Hightower (Bubba David smith ), Tackleberry (David Graf ), Jones (Michael Winslow ), Hooks (Marion Ramsey ), Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook ), Fackler (Bruce Mahler ), and Lassard ' s nephew, Nick (Matt McCoy) who transfers from Miami (in the previous film Police Acdemy 5) to the city to remain near to his friends and dull - witted uncle. After distributing flyers as to the information of the Wilson gang and getting nowhere, Nick McCoy stumbles upon a paper heading of an antique diamond heading to a museum, and gets an idea to use it as bait: however the robbers nab the diamond anyway by cutting a hole in the truck and escaping through the sewer system. McCoy then decides to go undercover to get information regarding a possible hideout, but Harris decides to go undercover to get a confession.

We see ads everywhere (buildings, walls, bus stops, e. t. c) for the hit game Slayers, and how the star character Kable (Gerard Butler) has four battles exit before he earns his freedom. We are then shown a battle in progress: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters get points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17 - year - old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays / controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his elbow room, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterward, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don ' t believe that anyone will be released from the game. The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the show - genius recluse Ken Castle, the godhead of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall ). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you privy get paid to embody controlled. Society rapidly became highly popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Rook defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one has ever survived that long ). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre - engineered actions to do, and will be set free if they survive just now one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high ). Also, the games are all televised on remuneration - per - view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano - cells implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their control back ). After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and province that eventually we will all be his slaves if we continue down this road. Castle gets a kick out of it and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. He talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sits by himself and is constantly thinking. He can ' t believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him why atomic number 2 ' s in prison. Kable has a straightaway flashback of a man hemorrhage in a room. Later on, while sitting in his cubicle, someone open the slot of the room access and hands Kable a picture of his married woman and child. The female voice on the other side know that his family is the only thing he fights for.

We see ads everywhere (buildings, walls, bus stops, e. t. c) for the hit game Slayers, and how the star character Kable (Gerard Butler) has four battles left before he earns his freedom. We are then shown a battle in progress: a massive shootout inside a manufactory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters generate points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial chore in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17 - year - old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays / controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterward, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don ' t believe that anyone will be released from the game. The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (Lavatory de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the show - adept recluse Ken Castle, the god almighty of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall ). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a literal person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay up to control someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. Society apace became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one has ever so survived that long ). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre - engineered actions to do, and will constitute set free if they survive just one battle, simply are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high ). Also, the games are all televised on pay - per - view. Everyone in Slayers and Society get had nano - cells implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their control back ). After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that eventually we will all be his slaves if we continue down this road. Castle gets a kick out of it and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison house, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and thinks astir his home. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. He talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sits by himself and is constantly thinking. He can ' t believe that Kable alone has three battles left. Freek asks him why he ' s in prison. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a way. Later on, while sitting in his cell, someone opens the slot of the door and hands Kable a picture of his wife and child. The distaff voice on the other side knows that his family is the only thing atomic number 2 fights for. She makes Kable sign an autograph for her son, David, and then takes a blood sample from his hand as proof of authenticity to increase the value of the autograph.

Though the film ' s symbolism is open to interpretation, the wall itself clear reflects a sense of isolation and alienation. Pink (Bob Geldof ), the protagonist (and unreliable narrator) of the film, is a rock star, one of several reasons behind his apparent depressive and detached emotional state. He is first seen in a quiet hotel room, having trashed it. The opening music represent not by Pink Floyd, but is the Vera Lynn recording of \" The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot \". During the following scenes, it live revealed that Pink ' s father, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pink ' s infancy. The reference personify almost for certain to the death of Roger Waters ' real - life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who died in combat in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944. The movie then flashes back to Pink as a young English boy growing up in the early 1950s. Throughout his childhood, Pink longs for a father figure after he learns his father died in the war. At school, he is humiliated by his mean and stern teacher for writing poems in class. The poems that the teacher seizes from him and reads aloud are lyrics from \" Money \" from the Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon. Pinko is also affected by his overprotective mother who spoils him by giving him whatever he wants. As an adult, Pink eventually gets married as his fame as a rock star grows, but he and his wife grow apart and she has an thing while Pink is on tour. When Pink learns of the affair, he compensates with expensive materialistic possession and turns to a willing groupie (Jenny Wright ), whom he brings back to his hotel room only to trash it in a fit of violence, causing her to fly the room in threat. Pink slowly begins to lose his mind to metaphorical \" worms \". He shaves off all of his body hair (an incident inspired by former bandmate Syd Barrett, who appeared at a 1975 read session of Wish You Were Here, having shaved his eyebrows and body tomentum) and, while watching The Dam Busters on television, morphs into his neo - Nazi alter - ego. Pink ' s manager (Bob Hoskins ), along with the hotel director (Michael Ensign) and some paramedics, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him aside into a waiting limousine outside the hotel and inject him with drugs to enable him to perform. The drug cause Pink to hallucinate and atomic number 2 fantasises that he is a neo - Nazi dictator, his concert is a rally. His followers proceed to attack ethnic minorities and rape the white girlfriend of a opprobrious man. Later, Pink holds a rally in suburban London, singing \" Waiting for the Worms \". The scene is inter - cut by images of animated marching hammers that goose - step across ruins. Pink screams \" Stop! \" and takes refuge in a bathroom stall at the concert venue, reciting poems which would later be used as lyrics on Pink Floyd ' s \" Your Possible Pasts \" from The Final Cut album and \" 5: 11 AM (The Moment Of Clarity) \" from Roger Waters ' The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. In a climatic animated sequence, Pink puts himself on trial. He is depicted as a small, pink rag doll that rarely be active. The judge is a giant pair of buttocks, with two backward facing legs, an anus for a mouth and a scrotum for a chin. The lawyer is a tall, menacing, vulturelike man and the schoolmaster is an abusive, hateful marionette. After hearing from the parties and witnesses (Garden pink ' s wife and mother ), the judge orders the wall to be torn downward. The wall explodes and shows a montage of events from the entire film.

According to the rules, the winner of the tournament will become the new King of England. Ector eagerly begins to have Kaye train, and in his excitement, promises Arthur that if he keeps working hard at his duties, he can go Kaye ' s squire. Merlin hears of this news, and decides to push Arthur to see his true potential drop (as Merlin stern move into the past and the future, he knows who Arthur will become ).

Arthur tries to defend Merlin, but his ' mouthing off ' ends cause Ector to declare that Arthur will not become Kaye ' s squire, and that that honor will belong to another person of the castle, who is named Hobbes. Arthur is dispirit at what has happened, but Merlin tries to get him to persevere, and plans to educate Arthur. As he attempts to explain things, Archimedes interjects on Merlin ' s teaching method, as Merlin is educating Arthur on things that will not be proven for hundreds of years, and could very well lead people to think of Arthur as a raving lunatic in their current Dark Ages. Exasperated at this lecturing, Merlin turns teaching duties over to Archimedes, while he fiddles with a model plane. Archimedes scoffs at the toy plane, while Merlin attempts to prove that ' man will fly. ' His efforts lead to the plane plummeting like a rock to the moat below.

As the helicopter lands, Gant lapses into a post - tramautic memory of a nightmare that he lived through in Vietnam: shot down over the North in his A - 4, he was being taken to a prison camp when two Hueys machine - gunned his captors. Gant suffered personal trauma when an overflying A - 4 dropped an incendiary on the site, killing a little girl who stood around too long, watching the battle.

NATO ' s descision is to send Gant in to steal a Firefox prototype right off the Soviet development base at Bilyarsk near the Ural Mountains. Gant resents the operation because he is being quite simply blackmailed; he has been allowed to live on government land which now will be sell out from under him if he does not agree to the delegation. The NATO Air Force attache (Thomas Hill) resent it, too, because Gant has no experience as a spy and, worse yet, is subject to post - traumatic stress disorder and may crack at any time. They use Gant for two reasons only if: he speaks silver Russian and happens to be a perfect fit for the pressure suit worn by the MiG - 31 ' s prime test pilot, Lt. Col. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff ). Gant goes through several weeks of retraining, both in flying and in aerial combat, and briefings on his first required impersonation - - as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, known to be smuggle heroin into the Soviet Union. After his training is over he is sent to London where Aubrey gives him his final briefing on his objectives and he ' s disguised with a new haircut and a false mustache. Gant is also familiarized with the underground network chemical group, who are mostly Russian Jews. Aubrey also hands him a one - way homing device disguised as a cheap transistor radio.

We see ads everywhere (buildings, walls, bus stops, e. triiodothyronine. blow) for the hit game Slayers, and how the star character Kable (Gerard Butler) has four battles left before he earns his freedom. We are then shown a battle in progress: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters get points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17 - year - old Simon (Mount logan Lerman) plays / controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterward, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now merely has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don ' t believe that anyone will live released from the game. The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the show - genius recluse Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall ). He first created a game called Society, which is essentially a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Ennead months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one has ever survived that long ). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre - engineered actions to do, and will constitute set free if they survive just one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate exceedingly high ). Also, the games constitute all televised on pay - per - view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano - cells implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the border of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their control back ). After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a electrical resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and province that eventually we will all be his slaves if we continue down feather this road. Castle gets a kick out of it and has his men sample to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. He talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sits by himself and is constantly thinking. He can ' t believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him why he ' s in prison house. Kable has a quick flashback of a valet de chambre bleeding in a room. Later on, while sitting in his cellular phone, someone opens the slot of the door and hands Kable a picture of his wife and child. The female voice on the other side knows that his family is the only thing he fights for. She makes Kable sign an autograph for her son, David, and then takes a blood sample from his hand as proof of legitimacy to increase the value of the john hancock.

He is first seen in a quiet hotel elbow room, having trashed it. The opening music is not by Pink Floyd, but is the Vera Lynn recording of \" The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot \". During the following scenes, it is revealed that Pink ' s father god, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pinko ' s infancy. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters ' real - life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who died in scrap in Italy during Operation Shake (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944. The movie then scoot back to Pink as a young Side boy growing up in the early 1950s. Throughout his childhood, Pink longs for a father figure after he learns his father died in the war. At school, he is humiliated by his mean and stern teacher for writing poems in class. The poems that the teacher seizes from him and reads aloud are lyrics from \" Money \" from the Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon. Pink is also affected by his overprotective mother who spoils him by giving him any atomic number 2 wants. As an adult, Pink eventually get married as his fame as a rock star grows, but he and his wife mature apart and she has an affair while Pink is on tour. When Pink learns of the affair, he compensates with expensive materialistic possessions and turns to a willing groupie (Jenny Wright ), whom he bestow back to his hotel room only to trash it in a fit of violence, stimulate her to flee the room in terror. Pink slowly begins to lose his mind to metaphorical \" worms \". He shaves off all of his body hair (an incident inspired by former bandmate Syd Barrett, who appeared at a 1975 recording session of Wish You Were Here, having shaved his eyebrows and body tomentum) and, while watching The Dam Busters on television, morphs into his neo - Nazi alter - ego. Pink ' s manager (Bob Hoskins ), along with the hotel manager (Michael Ensign) and some paramedics, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him away into a waiting limousine outside the hotel and inject him with drugs to enable him to perform. The drugs cause Pink to hallucinate and he fantasises that he is a neo - National socialist dictator, his concert is a rally. His followers proceed to attack ethnic minorities and rape the white girlfriend of a black man. Later, Pink holds a rally in suburban London, singing \" Waiting for the Worms \". The scene is inter - cut by images of animated marching hammers that goose - step across ruins. Pink screams \" Stop! \" and takes refuge in a bathroom stall at the concert venue, reciting poems which would later be used as lyrics on Pink Floyd ' s \" Your Possible Pasts \" from The Final Cut album and \" 5: 11 AM (The Minute Of Clarity) \" from Roger Waters ' The Pros and Con of Hitch Hike. In a climatic animated sequence, Pink puts himself on trial. He is depicted as a small, pink rag doll that rarely moves. The judge embody a giant pair of buttocks, with two backward facing legs, an anus for a mouth and a scrotum for a chin. The lawyer is a improbable, menacing, vulturelike man and the schoolmaster is an abusive, hateful marionette. After hearing from the parties and witnesses (Pink ' s wife and mother ), the judge orders the wall to be torn down. The wall explodes and shows a montage of events from the entire film.

That someone, Major Mitchell Gant us air force (Rtd) (Clint Eastwood ), hears the helicopter approaching and instantly breaks into a dead run back toward his cabin, where he takes a scattergun off information technology rack and cocks it. As the helicopter set ashore, Gant lapse into a post - tramautic memory of a nightmare that he lived through in Vietnam war: shot down over the North in his A - quatern, he was being taken to a prison camp when two Hueys machine - gunned his captors. Gant suffered personal trauma when an overflying A - 4 dropped an incendiary on the site, killing a little girl who stood around too long, watching the battle. Back in the present, Captain Arthur Buckholz (David Huffman) pulls Gant out of his episode and apologizes for the surprise. The next several scenes are back - and - forth cuts between the conversation between Gant and Buckholz, and a briefing being run by Kenneth Aubrey (Freddie Jones) of the British SIS concerning the Soviet Union ' s latest fighter / interceptor: the Mikoyan - Gurevich \" MiG \" Model 31, given the codename \" Firefox \" by NATO. Its capabilities seem otherworldly: total stealth, twin engines each delivering 50, 000 pounds of thrust, combat ceiling 100, 000 - feet - plus, speed in excess of Mach 5 or even Mach 6 (and able to keep it, no small feat ), and a weapons and defense system able to read the pilot ' s thoughts and countenance him to aim and fire his weapons without even having to press a button, thus affording him a 3 - to 5 - second reaction - time advantage over any opponent. NATO ' s descision is to send Gant in to steal a Firefox prototype right off the Soviet development base at Bilyarsk near the Ural Tidy sum. Gant resents the operation because he is being quite simply blackmail; he has been allowed to live on government land which now will be sold out from under him if he does not agree to the mission. The NATO Air Force attache (Thomas Hill) resents it, also, because Gant has no experience as a undercover agent and, worse yet, is subject to post - traumatic stress disorder and may crack at any time. They use Gant for two reasons only: he speaks fluent Russian and happens to be a perfect fit for the pressure suit worn by the MiG - 31 ' s prime test pilot, Lt. Col. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff ). Gant goes through several weeks of retraining, both in flying and in aerial combat, and briefings on his first required impersonation - - as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, known to equal smuggling diacetylmorphine into the Soviet North. After his training is over he is sent to London where Aubrey gives him his final briefing on his objectives and he ' s disguised with a new haircut and a false mustache. Gant is also familiarized with the underground network group, who are mostly Russian Jews. Aubrey also hands him a one - way homing device disguised as a cheap transistor radio. What his handlers don ' t tell him, though, is that if anything compromises the mission, Gant will be left on his own. Gant lands at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow, blusters his way through an unannounced customs search, and manages to leave the airport - - with the \" radio. \" He takes a taxi to his rooms at the Hotel Moscow, puts the radio into his pocket, and waits. Outside he sees three Soviet soldiers goose - stepping in constitution while patrolling. In the meantime, at KGB Moscow Center on Dzherzhinskiy Lame, Colonel Kontarsky (Kenneth Colley) of the soviet kgb finalizes his plans to safeguard the MiG - 31 prior to its trials the succeeding day which will be conducted for the Soviet First Secretary. He also orders his second - in - command, Dmitri Priabin (Oliver Cotton ), to arrest some underground members at dawn, but not to move before then.

Lassard assembles a 7 - man team consisting of Hightower (Bubba Smith ), Tackleberry (David Graf ), Jones (Michael Winslow ), Hooks (Marion Ramsey ), Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook ), Fackler (Bruce Mahler ), and Lassard ' s nephew, Nick (Matt McCoy) who transfers from Miami (in the previous film Police Acdemy 5) to the city to remain close to his admirer and dull - witted uncle. After distributing flyers as to the information of the Wilson gang and getting nowhere, Nick McCoy hit upon a paper heading of an antique diamond heading to a museum, and gets an idea to use it as bait: yet the robbers nab the diamond anyway by cutting a hole in the truck and escaping through the sewer system. McCoy then decides to go undercover to get information regarding a possible hideout, but Benjamin harris decides to go undercover to get a confession. It turns out that Harris goes undercover as a window washer at a tall building, for which he has a fear of heights, and gets a confession of himself on tape after his loyal but numb - skull lacky, Proctor, accidentally knocks him over the balcony.

We see advertisement everywhere (building, walls, bus stops, e. t. c) for the hit game Slayers, and how the star character Kable (Gerard Butler) has four battles left before he earns his freedom. We are then shown a battle in progress: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters get points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17 - yr - old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays / controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After massacre most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the struggle. Afterward, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The early characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other character don ' t believe that anyone will be released from the game. The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the appearance - wiz recluse Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall ). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players insure a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one has ever last that long ). Some convict are sent into battlefields with pre - engineered actions to do, and will be set free if they survive just one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high ). Also, the games are all televised on pay - per - view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano - cells implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by somebody else. They can only when be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their control back ). After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that finally we will all be his slaves if we continue down this road. Castle gets a kick out of it and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sit next to Kable. Helium talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sits by himself and is constantly thinking. He can ' t believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him wherefore he ' s in prison. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a room. Later on, while sitting in his cell, someone opens the slot of the door and hands Kable a picture of his wife and child. The female voice on the other side lie with that his family is the only thing he fights for.

During the following scenes, it is revealed that Pink ' s father, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pink ' s early childhood.

As the helicopter lands, Gant lapses into a post - tramautic memory of a nightmare that he lived through in Vietnam: shot down over the North in his A - 4, he was being rent to a prison camp when two Hueys motorcar - gunned his captors. Gant suffered personal trauma when an overflying A - 4 dropped an incendiary on the site, killing a little girl who stood around too long, watching the battle.

NATO ' s descision is to send Gant in to steal a Firefox image right off the Soviet development base at Bilyarsk near the Ural Mountains. Gant resents the operation because he is being quite simply blackmailed; he has been allowed to live on government land which now will follow sold out from under him if he does not agree to the mission. The NATO Air Force attache (Thomas Hill) resents it, too, because Gant has no experience as a spy and, worse yet, is subject to post - traumatic stress disorder and may crack at any time.

We are then shown a battle in progress: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is ensure by player elsewhere. Characters get points for each putting to death and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17 - year - old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays / controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterward, the surviving characters be transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on come through, since he now only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don ' t believe that anyone will be released from the game. The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the show - genius recluse Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Dorm ). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can make them do whatever they need. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one has ever survived that long ). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre - engineered actions to do, and will be set free if they survive just one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high ). Also, the games equal all televised on pay - per - view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano - cells implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their control back ). After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance mathematical group. The Humanz Blood brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that eventually we will all be his slaves if we continue down this road. Castle gets a kick out of it and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. He talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sits by himself and is constantly thinking. He fundament ' t believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him why he ' s in prison. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a room. Later on, while sitting in his cell, someone opens the slot of the door and hands Kable a picture of his married woman and child. The female voice on the former side knows that his family is the only thing he fights for. She makes Kable sign an autograph for her son, David, and then strike a blood sample from his hand as proof of authenticity to increase the value of the autograph.

During the following scenes, it is revealed that Pink ' s father, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pink ' s infancy. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters ' real - life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, world health organization died in combat in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944. The movie then flashes back to Pink as a young English boy growing up in the early 1950s. Throughout his childhood, Pink longs for a father figure after he learns his father died in the war. At school, he is humiliated by his mean and stern teacher for writing poems in class. The poems that the teacher seizes from him and reads aloud are lyrics from \" Money \" from the Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon. Pink is also affected by his overprotective mother who spoils him by giving him whatever he wants. As an adult, Pink eventually catch married as his fame as a rock star grows, but he and his wife grow apart and she have an affair while Pink is on tour. When Pink learns of the affair, he compensates with expensive materialistic possessions and turns to a willing groupie (Jenny Orville wright ), whom he brings back to his hotel room only to trash it in a fit of violence, causing her to flee the room in terror. Pink slowly begins to lose his creative thinker to metaphorical \" worms \". He shaves off all of his body hair (an incident inspired by erstwhile bandmate Syd Barrett, world health organization look at a 1975 recording session of Wish You Were Here, having shaved his eyebrows and body hair) and, while watching The Dam Busters on television, morphs into his neo - Nazi alter - ego. Pink ' s manager (Bob Hoskins ), along with the hotel manager (Michael Ensign) and some paramedics, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him away into a waiting limousine outside the hotel and interject him with drugs to enable him to perform. The drugs cause Pink to hallucinate and he fantasises that helium is a neo - National socialist dictator, his concert is a rally. His followers proceed to attack ethnic minorities and rape the white girlfriend of a black man. Subsequently, Pink holds a rally in suburban London, singing \" Waiting for the Worms \". The scene is inter - cut by images of animated marching hammers that goose - stair across ruins. Pink screams \" Stop! \" and takes refuge in a bathroom stall at the concert venue, reciting poems which would later be use as lyrics on Pink Floyd ' s \" Your Possible Pasts \" from The Final Cut album and \" 5: 11 artium magister (The Moment Of Clarity) \" from Roger Waters ' The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. In a climatic animated sequence, Pink puts himself on trial. He is depicted as a small, pink rag doll that rarely moves. The judge is a giant couplet of buttocks, with two backward facing legs, an anus for a mouth and a scrotum for a chin. The lawyer is a grandiloquent, menacing, vulturelike man and the schoolmaster is an opprobrious, hateful marionette. After hearing from the parties and witnesses (Pink ' s wife and mother ), the justice orders the wall to be torn down. The wall explodes and shows a montage of events from the entire film.

A few days later, Archimedes observes the arrival of Sir Pelinore, who has brought news from London of a jousting tournament to Ector and Kaye. According to the rules, the winner of the tournament will become the new King of England. Ector eagerly begins to have Kaye train, and in his excitement, promises Arthur that if he keeps working hard at his duties, he can become Kaye ' s squire. Merlin hears of this news, and decides to push Arthur to see his true potential (as Merlin can move into the past and the future, he knows who Arthur will become ). While walking outside along the castle ' s moat, Merlin explains that he can turn into a fish. This melodic theme excites Arthur, and Merline turns them both into fish, to search the moat. However, a much larger fish soon gives chase to young Arthur, until they both cope to escape. Arthur ' s tardiness in helping Kaye practice results in him washing dishes. Merlin finds him, and after bewitching the dishes and washing utensil, leads Arthur into the timberland, where they both are turned into squirrels by the sorcerer. As Arthur leaps among the trees, he comes across a girl squirrel, who is soon madly infatuated with him. Merlin finds the whole scenario cute, until he is soon found irresistible by another squirrel. Merlin then exchange himself and Arthur back to normal. The girl squirrel who was infatuated with Arthur, skitters away, heartbroken. Arthur and Merlin return to the castle, where Ector lectures Merlin for making Arthur shirk his duties. Arthur tries to defend Merlin, but his ' mouthing off ' ends causes Ector to declare that Arthur will not become Kaye ' s squire, and that that honor will belong to another person of the castle, who is named Hobbes. Arthur is dejected at what has happened, but Falco columbarius tries to get him to persevere, and architectural plan to educate Arthur. As he attempts to explain things, Archimedes interjects on Merlin ' s teaching methods, as Merlin is educating Arthur on things that will not be proven for hundreds of years, and could very well lead people to think of Arthur as a raving lunatic in their current Dark Ages. Exasperated at this lecturing, Merlin turns teaching duties over to Archimedes, while he fiddles with a model plane. Archimedes scoffs at the toy plane, while Falco columbarius attempts to prove that ' man bequeath fly. ' His efforts lead to the plane plummeting like a rock to the moat below. Even though the plane ' s flight was a failure, Arthur tells of how he ' s often dreamed of soar like a bird.

Pud tells Gramps that when he does a good deed, he will be able to make a wish. Because his apples are constantly being stolen, Gramps wishes that anyone who climbs up his apple tree will have to stay there until he permits them to climb down. Pud inadvertently tests the wish when he has trouble coming down from the tree himself, becoming free only when Gramps says he can.

That someone, Major Mitchell Gant USAF (Rtd) (Clint Eastwood ), hears the helicopter approaching and instantly breaks into a dead run back toward his cabin, where he takes a shotgun off its rack and cocks it. As the chopper lands, Gant lapses into a post - tramautic memory of a nightmare that he lived through in Vietnam: shot down over the North in his A - 4, he was being taken to a prison camp when two Hueys machine - gunned his captors. Gant suffered personal trauma when an overflying A - 4 dropped an incendiary on the site, killing a little little girl who stood around too long, watch the battle. Back in the present, Captain Arthur Buckholz (David Huffman) pulls Gant out of his episode and apologizes for the surprise.

Its capabilities seem otherworldly: total stealth, twin engines each delivering 50, 000 pounds of thrust, combat ceiling 100, 000 - feet - plus, speed in excess of Ernst mach 5 or even Mach 6 (and able to maintain it, no small feat ), and a weapon and defense system able to read the pilot ' s thoughts and allow him to aim and fire his weapons without even having to press a button, thus affording him a 3 - to 5 - second reaction - time advantage over any opponent. NATO ' s descision is to send Gant in to steal a Firefox prototype right off the Soviet development base at Bilyarsk near the Ural Mountains. Gant resents the operation because he is being quite simply blackmailed; he has been allowed to live on government land which now bequeath be sold out from under him if he does not agree to the mission. The NATO Air Force attache (Doubting thomas Hill) resents it, too, because Gant have no experience as a spy and, worse yet, is dependent to post - traumatic stress disorder and may crack at any time. They use Gant for two reasons only: he speaks fluent Russian and happens to be a perfect fit for the pressure suit worn by the MiG - 31 ' s select test pilot, Lt. Col. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff ). Gant goes through several weeks of retraining, both in flying and in aerial combat, and briefings on his first required impersonation - - as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, known to be smuggling heroin into the Soviet Union. After his training is over he is sent to London where Aubrey gives him his final briefing on his objectives and he ' s disguised with a new haircut and a false mustache. Gant is also familiarized with the underground network chemical group, who are mostly Russian Jews. Aubrey also hands him a one - way homing device disguised as a cheap transistor radio. What his handlers don ' t recite him, though, is that if anything compromises the mission, Gant will be left on his own. Gant lands at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow, blusters his way through an unannounced customs search, and manages to leave the airport - - with the \" radio. \" He takes a taxi to his rooms at the Hotel Moscow, puts the radio into his pocket, and waits.

We see ads everywhere (buildings, walls, bus stops, e. mt. c) for the hit game Slayers, and how the star character Kable (Gerard Butler) make four battles left before he earns his freedom. We are then shown a battle in progress: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters get points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17 - year - old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays / controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterward, the surviving characters be transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don ' t believe that anyone will be released from the game. The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the display - genius recluse Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Mansion house ). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one has ever survived that long ). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre - engineered actions to do, and will constitute set free if they survive just one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high ). Also, the games are all televised on pay - per - view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano - cellular phone implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their control back ). After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and state that eventually we will all be his slaves if we continue downcast this road. Castle gets a kick out of information technology and has his men try to locate where the signaling came from. In prison, a convict beats a safety device to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. He talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sit by himself and is constantly thinking. He can ' t believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him why he ' s in prison. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a room. Later on, while sitting in his cell, someone opens the slot of the door and reach Kable a picture of his wife and child. The female voice on the other side knows that his family is the only thing he fights for. She makes Kable sign an autograph for her word, David, and then takes a blood sample from his hand as proof of authenticity to increase the value of the autograph.

Though the film ' s symbolism is open to interpretation, the wall itself clearly reflects a sense of isolation and alienation. Pink (Bob Geldof ), the protagonist (and unreliable narrator) of the film, is a rock star, one of several reasons behind his apparent depressive and detached emotional state. He is first seen in a quiet hotel room, having trashed it. The opening music is not by Pink Floyd, but is the Vera Lynn recording of \" The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot \". During the following scenes, it follow revealed that Pink ' s father, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pink ' s infancy. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters ' real - life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who died in combat in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944. The movie then flashes back to Pink as a young English boy growing up in the early 1950s. Throughout his childhood, Pink longs for a father figure after he learns his church father died in the war. At school, he is humiliated by his mean and stern teacher for writing poems in class. The poems that the teacher seize from him and reads aloud are lyrics from \" Money \" from the Garden pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon. Pink is also affected by his overprotective mother who spoils him by giving him whatever he wants. As an adult, Pink eventually gets married as his fame as a rock star grows, but he and his wife grow apart and she stimulate an intimacy while Garden pink is on tour. When Pink learns of the affair, he compensates with expensive materialistic possessions and turns to a willing groupie (Jenny Wright ), whom he brings back to his hotel room only to trash it in a fit of violence, causing her to flee the room in terror. Pink slowly begins to lose his mind to metaphorical \" worms \". He shaves off all of his body hair (an incident inspired by former bandmate Syd Barrett, who appeared at a 1975 recording session of Wish You Were Here, having shaved his eyebrows and body pilus) and, while watching The Dam Busters on television, morphs into his neo - Nazi alter - ego. Pink ' s manager (Bob Hoskins ), along with the hotel managing director (Michael Ensign) and some paramedics, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him away into a waiting limousine outside the hotel and inject him with drugs to enable him to perform. The drugs cause Pink to hallucinate and he fantasises that he is a neo - Nazi dictator, his concert is a rally. His followers proceed to lash out ethnic minorities and rape the white girlfriend of a black man. Later, Pink holds a rally in suburban London, singing \" Hold off for the Worms \". The scene is inter - cut by images of animated marching hammers that goose - step across ruins. Pink screams \" Stop! \" and takes refuge in a bathroom stall at the concert venue, reciting poems which would later be used as words on Pink Floyd ' s \" Your Possible Pasts \" from The Final Cut album and \" 5: 11 AM (The Moment Of Limpidity) \" from Roger Waters ' The Pros and Cons of Stay Hiking. In a climatic animated sequence, Pink puts himself on trial. He is depicted as a small, pinkish rag doll that rarely moves. The judge is a giant pair of buttocks, with two backward facing legs, an anus for a mouth and a scrotum for a chin. The lawyer is a tall, menacing, vulturelike man and the schoolmaster is an abusive, hateful marionette. After hearing from the parties and witnesses (Pink ' s wife and mother ), the judge orders the wall to be torn down. The wall explodes and shows a montage of events from the entire film.

Some characters are demo to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17 - year - old Simon (Logan Lerman) play / controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterward, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don ' t believe that anyone will be released from the game.

He first created a game called Beau monde, which is basically a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Killer, a controversial game which is supported by the federal governance. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all destruction run in inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can abide alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no i has ever survived that long ). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre - engineered actions to do, and will be set free if they survive just one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high ). Also, the games are all televised on pay - per - view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano - cells implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be assure by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their control back ).

The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that eventually we will all be his hard worker if we continue down this road. Castle gets a kick out of it and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fails.

He talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when atomic number 2 sits by himself and is constantly thinking. He can ' t believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him why he ' s in prison. Kable has a quick flashback of a man hemorrhage in a room. Later on, while sitting in his cell, individual opens the slot of the door and hands Kable a picture of his wife and child.

He is first seen in a quiet hotel room, having trashed it. The opening music is not by Pink Floyd, but is the Vera Lynn recording of \" The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot \". During the following scenes, it is revealed that Pink ' s father, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pink ' s babyhood. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters ' real - life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who died in combat in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in Feb 1944. The movie then flashes back to Pink as a young English boy growing up in the early 1950s. Throughout his childhood, Pink longs for a father figure after he learns his male parent died in the warfare. At school, he is humiliated by his mean and stern teacher for writing poems in class. The poems that the teacher seizes from him and reads aloud are language from \" Money \" from the Pink Floyd record album Dark Side of the Moon.

As an adult, Pink finally gets married as his fame as a rock star grows, but he and his wife grow apart and she has an affair while Pink is on tour.

Pink ' s manager (Bob Hoskins ), along with the hotel manager (Michael Ensign) and some paramedics, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him away into a waiting limousine outside the hotel and inject him with drugs to enable him to perform. The drugs cause Pink to hallucinate and he fantasises that he is a neo - Nazi dictator, his concert is a rally.

In a climatic animated sequence, Pink puts himself on trial. He is depicted as a small, pink rag doll that rarely moves. The judge is a giant pair of buttocks, with two backward facing legs, an anus for a mouth and a scrotum for a chin. The lawyer is a tall, menacing, vulturelike man and the schoolmaster is an abusive, hateful marionette.

We see ads everywhere (buildings, walls, bus stops, e. t. c) for the hit game Slayers, and how the star character Kable (Gerard Butler) has four battles left before he gain his freedom. We are then shown a battle in progress: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters get points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to equal doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17 - year - old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays / controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blast outside of the mill. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterward, the exist characters are transported elsewhere. The other character congratulate Kable on winning, since he now only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don ' t believe that anyone will be released from the game. The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Stave, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Yardbird parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the show - mastermind recluse Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall ). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one has ever survived that long ). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre - engineered actions to do, and will be set free if they survive just one battle, but are unable to fend for themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high ). Also, the games are all televised on pay - per - view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano - cells implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their control back ). After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that eventually we will all be his slaves if we continue down this road. Castle gets a kick out of it and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and cerebrate about his family. Freek (Bathroom Leguizamo) sit down next to Kable. He talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sits by himself and is constantly thinking. He can ' t believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him why he ' s in prison house. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a room. Later on, while sit around in his cell, someone opens the slot of the door and hands Kable a picture of his wife and child. The female voice on the other side knows that his family is the only thing he fights for. She makes Kable sign an autograph for her son, David, and then takes a blood sample from his deal as proof of authenticity to increase the value of the autograph.

Merlin hears of this news, and determine to push Arthur to see his true potential (as Merlin can move into the past and the future, atomic number 2 knows who Arthur will become ).

Archimedes scoffs at the toy plane, while Merlin attempts to prove that ' man will fly. ' His efforts lead to the plane plummeting like a rock to the moat below.

We see ads everywhere (buildings, walls, bus stops, e. t. c) for the hit game Slayers, and how the star character Kable (Gerard Butler) has four battles left before he earns his freedom. We are then shown a battle in progress: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters get points for each kill and for saving a mate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17 - yr - old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays / controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterward, the surviving character reference are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don ' t believe that anyone will be released from the game. The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next invitee for the show - genius recluse Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall ). He first created a game called Society, which is essentially a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players insure a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayer, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the secret plan, though they live real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will exist set free (though no one has ever survived that long ). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre - engineered actions to do, and will be set free if they pull through just one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high ). Also, the game are all televised on pay - per - view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano - cells implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only comprise controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their control back ). After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that eventually we will all be his slaves if we continue down this road. Castle gets a gripe out of it and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict tick a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. He talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sits by himself and is constantly thinking. He can ' t believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him why he ' s in prison. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a room. Afterward on, while sitting in his cell, someone opens the slot of the door and hands Kable a picture of his wife and child. The distaff voice on the other side knows that his family is the only thing atomic number 2 fights for. She makes Kable sign an autograph for her word, David, and then takes a blood sample from his hand as proof of authenticity to increase the value of the autograph.

Pink (Bob Geldof ), the protagonist (and unreliable narrator) of the film, is a rock star, one of several reasons behind his evident depressive and detached emotional state. He is first seen in a quiet hotel room, having trashed it. The opening music is not by Pink Floyd, but is the Vera Lynn recording of \" The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot \". During the following scenery, it is revealed that Pink ' s father, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pink ' s infancy. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters ' real - life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who died in combat in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944. The movie then flashes back to Pink as a young English boy growing up in the early 1950s. Throughout his childhood, Pink longs for a father figure after he learns his father died in the war. At school, he is humiliated by his mean and stern teacher for writing poems in class. The poems that the teacher seizes from him and reads aloud are lyrics from \" Money \" from the Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon. Pink is also affected by his overprotective mother world health organization spoils him by giving him whatever he wants. As an adult, Pink eventually gets married as his fame as a rock and roll star grows, but he and his wife grow apart and she has an affair while Pink is on tour. When Pink learns of the affair, he compensates with expensive materialistic possessions and turns to a willing groupie (Jenny Willard huntington wright ), whom he brings back to his hotel room only to trash it in a fit of violence, causing her to flee the room in terror. Pink slowly begins to lose his mind to metaphoric \" worms \". He shaves off all of his body hair (an incident inspired by former bandmate Syd Barrett, who appeared at a 1975 recording session of Wish You Were Hither, having shaved his eyebrows and body hair) and, while watching The Dam Busters on television, morphs into his neo - Nazi alter - ego. Pink ' s coach (Bob Hoskins ), along with the hotel manager (Michael Ensign) and some paramedics, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him away into a waiting limousine outside the hotel and inject him with drugs to enable him to perform. The drugs cause Pink to hallucinate and he fantasises that he is a neo - Nazi dictator, his concert is a rally. His followers proceed to attack ethnic minorities and assault the white girlfriend of a black man. Later, Garden pink holds a rally in suburban London, singing \" Waiting for the Worms \". The scene is inter - cut by images of alive marching hammers that goose - step across wrecking. Pink screams \" Stop! \" and takes refuge in a bathroom stall at the concert venue, reciting poems which would later be used as lyrics on Pink Floyd ' s \" Your Possible Pasts \" from The Final Cut album and \" 5: 11 AM (The Moment Of Clarity) \" from Roger Waters ' The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. In a climatic animated sequence, Pink assign himself on trial. He is depicted as a small, pink rag doll that seldom moves. The judge is a giant pair of tail, with two backward facing legs, an anus for a mouth and a scrotum for a chin. The lawyer is a tall, menacing, vulturelike man and the schoolmaster is an abusive, hateful puppet. After hearing from the parties and witnesses (Pink ' s wife and mother ), the judge orders the wall to be torn down. The wall explodes and shows a collage of events from the entire film.

That someone, Major Mitchell Gant USAF (Rtd) (Clint Eastwood ), hears the helicopter approaching and instantly breaks into a bushed run back toward his cabin, where he takes a shotgun off its rack and cocks it. As the helicopter lands, Gant lapses into a post - tramautic memory of a nightmare that he lived through in Vietnam: shot down over the North in his A - 4, he was being taken to a prison camp when two Hueys machine - gunned his captors.

Back in the present, Captain Arthur Buckholz (David Huffman) pulls Gant out of his episode and apologizes for the surprise. The next several scenes be back - and - forth cuts between the conversation between Gant and Buckholz, and a briefing being run by Kenneth Aubrey (Freddie Jones) of the British SIS concerning the Soviet Union ' southward latest fighter / interceptor: the Mikoyan - Gurevich \" MiG \" Model 31, given the codename \" Firefox \" by NATO. Its capabilities seem otherworldly: total stealth, twin engines each delivering 50, 000 pounds of knife thrust, combat ceiling 100, 000 - feet - plus, speed in excess of Mach 5 or even Mach 6 (and able to maintain it, no small exploit ), and a weapons and defense system able to read the pilot ' s thoughts and allow him to aim and fire his weapons without even having to press a clit, thus affording him a 3 - to 5 - second reaction - time advantage over any opponent. NATO ' s descision is to send Gant in to steal a Firefox prototype right off the Soviet development base at Bilyarsk near the Ural Mountains. Gant resents the operation because he is being quite simply blackmailed; he has been allowed to live on government land which now will be sold out from under him if he does not agree to the mission. The NATO Air Force attache (Thomas Hill) begrudge it, too, because Gant has no experience as a spy and, worse yet, is open to post - traumatic stress disorder and may crack at any time. They use Gant for two reasons only: he speaks fluent Russian and happens to be a perfect fit for the pressure suit worn by the MiG - 31 ' s prime test pilot, Lt. Col. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff ). Gant go through several weeks of retraining, both in flying and in aerial combat, and briefings on his first required impersonation - - as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, known to be smuggling heroin into the Soviet Union. After his training is over he is sent to London where Aubrey gives him his final briefing on his objectives and atomic number 2 ' s disguised with a new haircut and a false moustache. Gant is also familiarized with the underground network group, who are mostly Russian Jews. Aubrey also hands him a one - way homing device disguised as a cheap transistor radio. What his handlers don ' t tell him, though, is that if anything compromises the mission, Gant will be left on his own. Gant lands at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow, blusters his way through an unannounced customs search, and manages to leave the airport - - with the \" radio. \" He takes a taxi to his rooms at the Hotel Moscow, puts the radio into his pocket, and waits. Outside he sees three Soviet soldiers goose - stepping in formation while patrolling. In the meanwhile, at KGB Moscow Center on Dzherzhinskiy Square, Colonel Kontarsky (Kenneth Colley) of the KGB finalise his plans to safeguard the MiG - 31 prior to its trials the next day which will be conducted for the Soviet First Secretary. He also orders his second - in - command, Dmitri Priabin (Oliver Cotton ), to arrest some underground members at dawn, but not to move before then.

We see ads everywhere (buildings, walls, bus stops, e. t. c) for the hit game Slayers, and how the star character Kable (Gerard Butler) has four battles left before he earns his freedom. We are then shown a battle in progress: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters get points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the furiousness around them. xvii - year - old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays / controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to succeed the battle. Afterward, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now only has three conflict left until exemption. Some of the other characters put on ' t believe that anyone will be released from the game. The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the show - genius recluse Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall ). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game but instead of ascertain a fake character, the players control a literal someone and can make them set whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle create Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one has ever survived that long ). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre - engineered actions to do, and will be set free if they survive simply one struggle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high ). Also, the games are all televised on pay - per - view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano - cells implanted into their brain, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game is ended, they get their control back ). After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that eventually we will all be his slaves if we continue down this road. Castle gets a kick out of it and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape only in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. He talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sit by himself and is constantly thinking. He can ' t believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him why he ' s in prison house. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a room. Later on, while sitting in his cell, someone opens the slot of the door and hands Kable a picture of his wife and child. The female voice on the other side knows that his family is the only thing he fights for.

That someone, Major Mitchell Gant USAF (Rtd) (Clint Eastwood ), hears the helicopter approaching and instantly breaks into a dead run back toward his cabin, where he takes a shotgun off its rack and cock it. As the helicopter lands, Gant lapses into a post - tramautic memory of a nightmare that he lived through in Vietnam: shot down over the North in his A - 4, he was being taken to a prison camp when two Hueys machine - gunned his captor. Gant suffered personal trauma when an overflying A - 4 dropped an incendiary on the site, killing a little girl who stood around too long, watching the battle. Back in the present, Captain Arthur Buckholz (David Huffman) pulls Gant out of his episode and apologise for the surprise. The next several scenes are back - and - forth cuts between the conversation between Gant and Buckholz, and a briefing being run by Kenneth Aubrey (Freddie Jones) of the British SIS concerning the Soviet Union ' s latest fighter / interceptor: the Mikoyan - Gurevich \" MiG \" Model 31, given the codename \" Firefox \" by NATO. Its capabilities seem otherworldly: total stealth, twin engines each delivering 50, 000 pounds of thrust, fight ceiling 100, 000 - feet - plus, speed in excess of Mach 5 or even Mach 6 (and able to maintain it, no small feat ), and a weapons and defense system able to read the pilot ' s thoughts and allow him to aim and fire his weapons without even having to press a button, thus affording him a 3 - to 5 - second reaction - time advantage over any opponent. NATO ' s descision is to send Gant in to steal a Firefox prototype right off the Soviet maturation base at Bilyarsk near the Ural Mountains. Gant resents the operation because he is being quite simply blackmailed; he has been allow to live on government land which now will be sold out from under him if he does not agree to the mission. The NATO Air Force attache case (Thomas Hill) resents it, too, because Gant has no experience as a spy and, worse yet, is subject to post - traumatic stress disorder and may crack at any time. They use Gant for two reasons only: he speaks fluent Russian and happens to be a perfect fit for the pressure suit worn by the MiG - 31 ' s prime test pilot, Lt. Col. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff ). Gant goes through several weeks of retraining, both in fly and in aerial combat, and briefings on his first required impersonation - - as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, known to be smuggling heroin into the Soviet Union. After his training is over he is sent to London where Aubrey gives him his final briefing on his objectives and he ' s disguised with a new haircut and a false mustache. Gant is also familiarized with the underground network group, who are mostly Russian Jews. Aubrey also hands him a one - way homing device disguised as a cheap transistor radio set. What his handlers don ' t say him, though, represent that if anything compromises the mission, Gant will be left on his own. Gant farming at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow, swash his way through an unannounced customs duty search, and manages to leave the airport - - with the \" radio. \" He takes a cab to his rooms at the Hotel Moscow, puts the radio into his pocket, and waits. Outside he sees three Soviet soldiers goose - stepping in geological formation while patrolling. In the meantime, at KGB Moscow Center on Dzherzhinskiy Square, Colonel Kontarsky (Kenneth Colley) of the KGB finalizes his plans to safeguard the MiG - 31 prior to its trials the next day which will be conducted for the Soviet First Secretary.

We are then shown a battle in progress: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters get points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17 - year - old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays / controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted remote of the mill. Kable manages to run to the safe point to get ahead the battle. Afterward, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on come through, since he now only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don ' t believe that anyone will be released from the game. The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Display discuss their next guest for the show - genius recluse Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks astir the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall ). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the player control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control person else, or you can get paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, make Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Rook defends Slayers by say that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one has ever survived that long ). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre - engineered actions to do, and leave be set free if they survive just one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high ). Also, the games are all televised on pay - per - view. Everyone in Slayer and Society has had nano - cells implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their restraint back ). After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that eventually we will all be his slaves if we continue down this route. Castle gets a kick out of it and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sit next to Kable. He talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sits by himself and is constantly thinking. He can ' t believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him why he ' s in prison. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a room. Later on, while sitting in his cell, someone opens the slot of the door and hands Kable a picture of his wife and child. The female voice on the other side knows that his family is the sole thing he fights for. She makes Kable sign an autograph for her son, David, and then takes a blood sample from his hand as proof of authenticity to increase the value of the autograph.

In a climatic animated sequence, Pink puts himself on trial. He is depicted as a small, pinkish rag doll that rarely moves.

Exasperated at this lecturing, Merlin turns teaching duties over to Archimedes, while he fiddles with a model plane.

As the helicopter lands, Gant lapses into a post - tramautic memory of a nightmare that he lived through in Vietnam: shot down over the North in his A - 4, he was be taken to a prison camp when two Hueys machine - gunned his captors. Gant suffered personal trauma when an overflying A - 4 dropped an incendiary on the site, killing a little girl who stood around too long, watching the battle.

NATO ' s descision is to send Gant in to steal a Firefox prototype right off the Soviet development radical at Bilyarsk near the Ural Mountains. Gant resents the operation because he is being quite simply blackmailed; he has been allowed to live on government land which now will be sold out from under him if he does not agree to the mission. The NATO Air Force attache (Thomas Hill) resents it, too, because Gant has no experience as a spy and, worse yet, is subject to post - traumatic stress disorderliness and may crack at any time. They use Gant for two reasons only: he speaks fluent Russian and come about to be a perfect fit for the pressure suit worn by the MiG - 31 ' s prime test pilot, Lt. Col. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff ). Gant goes through several weeks of retraining, both in flying and in airy combat, and briefings on his first required impersonation - - as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, known to be smuggling heroin into the Soviet Union. After his training is over he is sent to London where Aubrey gives him his final briefing on his objectives and he ' s disguised with a new haircut and a false mustache. Gant is also familiarized with the underground network group, who are mostly Russian Jews. Aubrey also hands him a one - way homing device disguised as a cheap transistor radio.

We see ads everywhere (buildings, walls, bus stops, e. t. c) for the hit game Slayers, and how the star character Kable (Gerard Butler) has four battles left before he earns his freedom. We are then shown a fight in progress: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is assure by players elsewhere. Characters get points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17 - year - previous Herbert alexander simon (Logan Lerman) plays / controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterward, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters get into ' t believe that anyone will be released from the game. The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the show - genius recluse Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall ). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest someone in the universe. Nine month ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the plot instead of do their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one have got ever survived that long ). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre - engineered actions to do, and will be set free if they survive scarce one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high ). As well, the game are all televised on pay - per - view. Everyone in Slayer and High society has had nano - cells implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their control back ). After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistor group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that eventually we will all be his slaves if we continue down this road. Castle gets a kick out of it and has his men try to turn up where the signal do from. In prison house, a convict beats a guard to end and tries to escape but in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits future to Kable. He talk about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sits by himself and is constantly thinking. He can ' t believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him why he ' s in prison. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a room. Later on, while sitting in his cell, someone opens the slot of the door and hands Kable a picture of his wife and child. The female voice on the other side knows that his family is the only matter he fights for. She makes Kable sign an autograph for her son, David, and then takes a blood sample from his hand as proof of authenticity to increase the value of the autograph.

Though the film ' s symbolism is open to interpretation, the rampart itself clearly reflects a sense of isolation and alienation. Pink (Bob Geldof ), the protagonist (and unreliable narrator) of the film, is a tilt star, i of several reasons behind his apparent depressive and detached emotional state. He is first seen in a quiet hotel room, having trashed it. The opening music is not by Pink Floyd, but is the Vera Lynn recording of \" The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot \". During the following scenes, it be revealed that Pink ' s church father, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pink ' s infancy. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters ' real - life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who died in combat in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944. The movie then flashes back to Pink as a young English boy growing up in the early 1950s. Throughout his childhood, Pink longs for a father figure after he learns his father died in the war. At schoolhouse, he is humiliated by his mean and stern teacher for writing poems in class. The poems that the instructor seizes from him and reads aloud are lyrics from \" Money \" from the Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon. Pink is also affected by his overprotective mother who spoils him by giving him whatever he wants. As an grownup, Pink eventually gets married as his fame as a rock star grows, but he and his wife grow apart and she has an affair while Pink is on tour. When Pink learns of the affair, he compensates with expensive materialistic possessions and turns to a willing groupie (Jenny Wright ), whom he brings back to his hotel room only to trash it in a fit of violence, causing her to flee the room in terror. Pink slowly begins to lose his mind to metaphorical \" worms \". He shaves off all of his body hair (an incident inspired by former bandmate Syd Barrett, who appeared at a 1975 recording session of Wish You Were Here, having shaved his eyebrows and eubstance hair) and, while watching The Dam Busters on television, morphs into his neo - Nazi alter - ego. Pink ' s manager (Bob Hoskins ), along with the hotel manager (Michael Ensign) and some paramedics, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him away into a wait limousine outside the hotel and inject him with drugs to enable him to perform. The drugs cause Pink to hallucinate and he fantasises that he is a neo - Nazi dictator, his concert is a rally. His followers proceed to attack ethnic minorities and rape the white girlfriend of a black man. Later, Pink go for a rally in suburban London, singing \" Waiting for the Worms \". The scene is inter - cut by images of animated marching hammers that goose - step across ruins. Pink screams \" Stop! \" and takes refuge in a bathroom booth at the concert venue, reciting poems which would later be used as lyrics on Pink Floyd ' s \" Your Possible Pasts \" from The Final Cut album and \" quintet: 11 AM (The Moment Of Clarity) \" from Roger Waters ' The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. In a climatic animated sequence, Pink puts himself on trial. He is depicted as a modest, pink rag doll that rarely moves. The judge is a giant pair of buttocks, with two backward facing legs, an anus for a mouth and a scrotum for a kuki. The lawyer is a tall, menacing, vulturelike man and the schoolmaster is an abusive, hateful marionette. After hearing from the parties and witnesses (Pink ' s wife and mother ), the justice orders the wall to be torn down. The wall explodes and shows a montage of events from the entire film.

NATO ' s descision is to send Gant in to steal a Firefox prototype right off the Soviet development base at Bilyarsk near the Ural Mountains. Gant resents the operation because he is being quite simply blackmailed; he has been allowed to live on government country which now will exist sold out from nether him if he does not agree to the mission. The NATO Air Force attache (Thomas Hill) resents it, too, because Gant has no experience as a spy and, worse yet, is subject to post - traumatic stress disorder and may crack at any time. They use Gant for two reasons only: he speaks fluent Russian and happens to be a perfect fit for the pressure suit worn by the MiG - 31 ' s prime test pilot, Lt. Gap. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff ). Gant goes through several weeks of retraining, both in flying and in aerial combat, and briefings on his 1st required impersonation - - as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, known to be smuggling heroin into the Soviet Union. After his training is over he is sent to London where Aubrey gives him his final briefing on his objectives and he ' s disguised with a new haircut and a false mustache. Gant is also familiarized with the underground meshing group, who are mostly Russian Jews. Aubrey also hands him a one - way homing device mask as a cheap transistor radio.

We are and so shown a battle in progress: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters get decimal point for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are usher to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly incognizant of all the violence around them. 17 - year - old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays / controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterward, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don ' t believe that anyone will be released from the game. The producer (Michael Edward weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the show - sensation recluse Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Palace (Michael C. Hall ). He first created a game called Society, which be basically a Sims game but instead of contain a fake character, the players control a real individual and can make them do any they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get paid to represent controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they be real people, are all destruction row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one has ever survived that long ). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre - engineered actions to do, and will be set free if they survive just one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high ). Also, the games are all televised on pay - per - view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano - cells implanted into their brain, which makes it potential for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the margin of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their control back ). After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that eventually we will all be his slaves if we continue down this road. Castle gets a kick out of it and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. He talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sits by himself and is constantly thinking. He can ' t believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek require him why he ' s in prison. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a room. Later on, while sitting in his cell, someone opens the slot of the door and hands Kable a picture of his wife and child. The female voice on the other side knows that his family is the only thing he fights for.

Though the film ' atomic number 16 symbolism is open to interpretation, the wall itself clearly reflects a sense of isolation and alienation. Pink (Bob Geldof ), the protagonist (and unreliable narrator) of the film, is a rock star, one of several reasons behind his apparent depressive and detached aroused state. He be first seen in a quiet hotel room, having trashed it. The opening music is not by Pink Floyd, but is the Vera Lynn recording of \" The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot \". During the following scenes, it is revealed that Pink ' s father, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pink ' s infancy. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters ' real - life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who died in combat in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944. The movie then flashes back to Pink as a youthful English boy get up in the early 1950s. Throughout his puerility, Pink longs for a father figure after he learns his father died in the war. At school, he is humiliated by his mean and stern teacher for writing poems in class. The poems that the teacher seizes from him and reads aloud are lyrics from \" Money \" from the Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon. Pink is also affected by his overprotective mother who spoils him by giving him whatever he wants. As an adult, Pink eventually gets married as his fame as a rock star grows, but he and his wife grow apart and she has an affair while Pink is on spell. When Pink learns of the affair, he compensates with expensive materialistic possessions and turns to a willing groupie (Jenny Wright ), whom he brings back to his hotel room only when to trash it in a fit of violence, causing her to flee the room in terror. Pink slowly begins to suffer his mind to metaphorical \" worms \". He shaves off all of his body hair (an incident inspired by former bandmate Syd Barrett, who appeared at a 1975 recording seance of Wish You Were Hither, having shaved his eyebrows and body hair) and, while ascertain The Dam Busters on television, morphs into his neo - Nazi alter - ego. Garden pink ' s manager (Bob Hoskins ), along with the hotel manager (Michael Ensign) and some paramedics, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him away into a waiting limousine outside the hotel and inject him with drugs to enable him to perform. The drugs cause Pink to hallucinate and he fantasises that he is a neo - Nazi dictator, his concert is a rally. His followers go to attack ethnic minorities and rape the white girlfriend of a black man. Later, Pink holds a rally in suburban London, singing \" Waiting for the Worms \". The scene is inter - cut by images of animated marching hammers that goose - step across ruins. Pink screams \" Stop! \" and takes refuge in a bathroom stall at the concert venue, reciting poems which would later be used as lyrics on Pink Floyd ' s \" Your Possible Pasts \" from The Final Cut album and \" 5: 11 AM (The Moment Of Clarity) \" from Roger Waters ' The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hike. In a climatic animated sequence, Pink puts himself on trial. He is depicted as a small, pink rag doll that rarely moves. The judge is a giant pair of buttocks, with two backward facing legs, an anus for a sassing and a scrotum for a chin. The lawyer is a tall, menacing, vulturelike man and the schoolmaster is an abusive, hateful marionette. After hearing from the parties and witnesses (Pink ' s wife and mother ), the judge orders the wall to be torn down. The wall explodes and shows a montage of events from the entire film.
